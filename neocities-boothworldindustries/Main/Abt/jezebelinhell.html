<p>I like to imagine with this being a *personal* website, that everything here is a capsule of things about me. So this page is mostly for things I don't have reasoning to put on other pages, or ways to bug me. You can check out my shrines for more in-depth reviews of things I like, (Assuming I got off my ass to make them) and my blog for whatever I'm doing as of late. If you'd like to contact me personally, I'm fine with chatting over <a href="mailto:cogsincorporated@protonmail.com">e-mail</a>. (Please don't come to me for coding help or "how-to", although I am fine talking with new Webmasters about starting out!) If you need something quickly from me, you can find me on Discord under "itsabmovie". (But I do delete people from my friends list rather quickly if you haven't messaged me.) I can be found as "mvkgant" or "itsabmovie" under most websites and services.</p>

<p>I decided to make this page more simple/barren then my other pages, since I don't want to worry about constantly being unsatisifed with its layout. My name is Beau (Pronounced like "bo" in "bow and arrow".) you can also call me Victor or Flint. I'm born February 6th 2006, making my Chinese zodiac the dog and my star sign Aquarius. (I don't know any of that other stuff, but I think its cool) I'm currently 19 years old. I'm right handed, my favorite color is red and brown, my favorite ice cream flavor is coffee or strawberry. According to the MTBI stuff my friends made me take, I'm a INTJ. I don't like locking myself into a genre of style, since I think everyone flucates, consistently I am a crossdresser across genres. And for those who care, a friend of Dorothy.</p>

<p>My interest in HTML or technology in general has been very present thru out my life, I used to spend hours working on my Planet Minecraft, DeviantArt, and forum profiles. When user customization started to phase out of popularity (Or becoming pay-walled for us 12 year olds) I moved to more standard SNS platforms. This was a very odd period of my life where I realize I was watering down my personality and things I liked to try and find community. I became inspired to create a website after finding <a href="https://gundham.neocities.org/">Gundham</a> being shared in a chat I was in. Something about the site really struck a chord with me, it felt like its own little realm and handcrafted world. Something I craved, individuality. If that Webmaster is out there somewhere, I just want to say thank you.</p>

<p>Since that day on August 4th 2021, my website has gone thru many revisions and changes. This is not my first website, nor the first time I've used Neocities as a hoster actually. When I was younger, around 11 years old, I dabbled with a shitty webpage with some of my friends. It was nothing revolutionary, just Gorillaz and Ace Attorney fanart. I'd put the center tag at the start of *every* line to ensure it was centered... shivers. I didn't continue since I didn't feel very inspired to, or saw a point. Sometime in 2020, I created a website named "theinfirmary", which was again mostly for piddling around with learning HTML. I don't recall what made me want to make this site? Nonetheless, the only surviving evidence I have of it is this screenshot from Discord when I was testing out the description.</p>

<img src="/Main/Abt/old.jpg" width="350" style="border: 3px outset #352424; background-color: #4f4f4f;">

<p>I deleted it after finding out it gained 500 views, which freaked me out that people saw my dinky test website. (Which was nothing to worry about looking back on it now) The only notable thing on it was a photo of Thrax from Osmosis Jones, when you hovered over him I called him hot or something. I also created another website called "aceattorneyvillains" on August 19th 2021, a fansite for the villains from the Ace Attorney series; which I worked on more for a brief while before this site. I worked on it while I was rather sick to pass time, and as you can infer by the front page if you go seeking it, its archived. The links are all broken now from me not being very wise and using hotlinking (Which is what you deserve by the way) and I'm just too lazy to delete it right now. So view it thru the waybackmachine if you want to. You can also find other archived pages on the "Museum" page.</p>

<p>Eventually I shifted focus back onto my personal website, which you're at(!), but I also maintain other sites you can find on the front page. Previously, the URL was "gyakutenkenji2", which is the title of my favorite game in the Ace Attorney series. And then shifted to "blaisedebeste", a name of a character from the previously mentioned game. And finally, it has been "boothworldindustries", and will likely stay that way. Titled after my favorite scary internet horror story. Creating my website has been a outlet for me in numerous ways in both expressing myself and harnessing a new skill. Even if I complain about posers or SNS users out of my own pettiness, I encourage anyone to dabble in some HTML atleast once, even if its nothing grand. I think in the current digital age we find ourselves in, the best we can do is just try to make a space for ourself. Its 1999, everyone has a website!</p>

<p>Apart from HTML, I also have a hobby in art and primarily draw digitally. (You can find some examples on the mysteriously labelled "Art" page.) One day I want to start working more with psychical media like claymation and puppets; which also is apart of my interest in sewing. I'd say some of my inspirations would be Osamu Sato, John Dilworth, Martin Walls, and the style of Crashbox. I also love stage costumes, masks, and commedia dell'arte. (Particularly Harlequinade) I like vintage clothing, mainly the victorian eras, 70s, 80s, and some 90s. My favorite fashion designer would have to be Thierry Mugler and Vivienne Westwood. I'd describe my personal style as "kindergarten teacher on Halloween", "dead 80s businessman", and "return your tapes to walmart".</p>

<p>I said in the first paragraph that I'd prefer my pages speak for themselves in my interests, but to reiterate some of my favorite things.. My special interests are Team Fortress 2, (Since 2016!) Vocaloid, Toontown Online, (Specifically the private server Corporate Clash) Crashbox, and The Brave Little Toaster. My on-again-off-again interests would have to be Postal, Revolutionary Girl Utena, Moral Orel, and Ace Attorney. Some of my favorite musicians would have to be Alternative Radio, Oingo Boingo, The Hoosiers, Poe, Destinys Child, Garbage, Shinedown, Mitski, In This Moment, Meiko Nakahara, Miki Mastubara, TLC, and Luxury Elite. ..Got all that?</p>

<p>I wouldn't call myself exactly spiritual, but it'd be a lie to say I don't have beliefs in certain ways that I think of seriously. My main belief is that everything has a soul to some level, and whatever you truly believe in is real to some capacity; karma basically. Personally, I believe in past lives and reincarnation. I never liked conspiracy theory bullshit like discussing aliens (Although I find the concept interesting, I'm rather turned off from discussing it at the moment) I think what lies on earth is much more interesting, before we start worrying about outside forces.. I feel a very strong connection to computers, some may call it a "kinship". I think things like computers or modern technology are wrongly persecuted for the way humans utilize them, to avoid confronting their own society. I believe technology and humans are not as far apart as people like to make them. Think about it, if humans weren't there to maintain them, computers are just as organic as we in their inevitable decay. Everything is alive to some level, even dead bodies have some type of system in them So sure, I'd align myself with computers more in a sense.</p>

<p>The people that make life on this rock the most meaningful would have to be my darling, <a href="/Main/MyDarling/moncherie">Benjamin</a>. And my best friend, <a href="/Main/Dollhouse/ballroom">Pinkie</a>.</p>

<!--(Idea stolen from Benjamin, with no permission at all) Songs I'd resonate with would be "Love Is Mine All Mine" by Mitski and "Doll Parts" by Hole. If you want characters I relate to, or see myself in, heres some of them. I also resonate with ghosts, zombies, mannequins, and specifically the "Bossbots" from Toontown Online. Animals I feel towards would be rats, vultures, black cats, and hellhounds.-->

<p>I can't control how people view my website or the things I do, but I want to say the goal of my site was never to be something "revolutionary" or "aesthetic". I don't think I'm special-er or have something unique then anyone else on this hoster. With that said, I think the community is something important; and the Neocities community has been the kindest one I've been in. I know some people kind of shy away from it since they think it ruins their "no SNS" tough guy persona, which I understand due to the way the modern web is. I want to thank anyone who signs my guestbook or leaves a comment, I'm admittedly rather shy <s>and forget my guestbook login to reply</s> but I revisit them constantly. I'm not stupid in thinking people can't have opinions about what I do, since this is publicly available on the World Wide Web. But if thats the case, you should go make your own. And I don't mean that negatively! I hope we can all make something we love someday.</p>
