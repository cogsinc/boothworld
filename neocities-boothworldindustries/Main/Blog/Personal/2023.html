<p><mark>Surprise everyone, I have not died. I've mentioned it before but I've been going thru depression. I swear, I'll stop mentioning it all the time when spring rolls around lol</mark></p>

<p><mark>You've likely noticed I ended up deleting quite a bit of blog entries, so no you're not crazy for thinking "Hey wasn't there more here?". Its not really that I'm "ashamed" of them or something, its just when I reread those over I don't see myself. I see someone pretending. Someone pretending and playing up being overly happy. And thats just like, totally not my style yknow? I mean duh I can be happy, I mean I was just doing it for the sake of other people.</mark></p>

<p><mark>So recently I've been trying to do some more meditation, its kind of personal so I won't go too deep into it but I've been reconsiling with my past lives and my current self. To blend them into one whole being again. Or becoming content with the lives before me. Not "letting go" of them, but accepting I can't return there. I can talk about my memories there and my feelings, but its about acceptance of my current self and life mainly.</mark></p>

<p><mark>Its been going pretty well, I mean I'm still depressed all things considered but I feel a sense of ease on my mind in a way. I don't neccessarily consider myself a "religious" person, I don't follow any or believe in any specific God. I am however vaguely spiritual and like to believe in things like ghosts, folklore, and obviously reincarnation. My whole philosphy is that if you *truly* believe in something, its real in a way. So if you're Christian and believe in the Heaven and Hell thing, you'll go there. If you believe theres nothing after death, it'll be like that. And for me, I just believe in reincarnation and karma.</mark></p>

<p><mark>I've denied myself this aspect of myself for a long time because I believed it was just "cringy" or "makes no sense". ..And then I was watching a bunch of cult documentaries with my mom. And I thought of how many people use these things as tools of hatred and hurt. And I want to define myself, not others for me. So if my beliefs are oddly specific and make no sense to anyone else, so be it!</mark></p>

<p><mark>I've been really back and forth on my mom. Quite frankly, my trauma is no one elses business really. But I've always been silenced in a way by other people, I don't make noise because I've been beaten down mentally to be "easy". Not by my mom persay, but by other people. And that carries over of course..</mark></p>

<p><mark>My mom has changed alot over the past years. I don't really recognize her from when I was even 14. Which I guess is why I have such a hard time really grasping traumatic parts of my childhood. Do I ask her about it? Will that just make it worse again? Is it worth it? Should I just handle it myself? I think I will. Its just not worth the headache and possible strain. I mean, I guess you can say "Are you sure your relationship is really *that* good if you can't talk to her about it?" But just.. let me feel okay with it for once. I still harbor feelings of disgust towards my parents, and like I'm trapped. But I think I can atleast begin to feel a bit more tolerable until I'm in a place to handle it alone. And when I'm an adult and live on my own I'll try again.</mark></p>

<p><mark>Its just weird. Like my mom lets me talk about some pretty progressive things and agrees with me, but the weird part is she acts like she and my dad have *always* been accepting. Not like they were in denial of my sister being a lesbian, or tried to make me a "lesser trans". My mom has even told me to my face she has to "remind herself" that I'm not her.</mark></p>

<p><mark>Well, anyways, thats a bit of my problem. I ruminate over these things over and over again when there is no solution. And it just hurts my head and spirit. Not saying I should be ignorant, but sometimes theres only so much "self reflection" you can do until its out of your control. I need to stop blaming myself for things out of my control.</mark></p>

<p><mark>I still feel empty in many regards. I feel empty right now even as a person. But I hope that the person I am will start to become more apparent to me as time goes on. I don't think I'll be doing alot of website or artwork until next year, and probably journaling too. I think I.. have looked into my brain enough for the last month of the year xD New years always scare me. Last new year I remember I was crying while eating peanut butter and jelly sandwiches because I felt like I hadn't accomplished anything. And I mean, I haven't really yet. But I have 70 something years ahead of me or so. I have plenty of time I think..</mark></p>

<p><mark>I'm going to try to take Janruary off to just relax and not really do anything. I'll likely start productivity again in February, when I'm 18 and get my legal name change. Until then, happy holidays everyone.. :] Lets all hope next year is kinder to us.</mark></p>

<h3><u><i><mark><font color="#9e001c">[December 15th 2023]</font></i></u></h3></mark>
<p><mark>So you're probably gonna notice a big gap between this entry and the last, I did write a bit for December but upon re-reading it decided it was just way too personal. I mean like, I'm pretty personal as-is on this website and my blog but more of just "Thats The Seasonal Depression Talking". Not to say my feelings I wrote are invalid, just that it was more brought on by a poor mental health spiral.</mark></p>

<p><mark>I've been feeling ok this month, my depression had a very big high the first week or so. I don't really know how to word it apart from the sterotypical "cloud looming over me" talk. Just a sense of sadness and hopelessness everyday type.</mark></p>

<p><mark>My mom brought up the idea of me moving rooms around. I said that my current room felt overwhelming and like I couldn't keep up with it. So we planned out having my big room being the "media storage/guest room" and converting her old office room (Which was my old bedroom from when I was a kid) back into my room, and moving her office back into the current guest room. Essentially playing musical chairs. ...Got all that?</mark></p>

<p><mark>Its a really nice little space, although I will say there are times I feel a bit claustrophobic for some reason. I think just the memories this room has makes me a bit antsy? But oh well, I'm going to choose to ignore that.</mark></p>

<p><mark>I said something a bit ago on my Tumblr about how the days feel shorter, and how I feel like I'm being thrust forward into the future. Often I feel mentally stuck in the past, but I think thats a common thing for many people nowadays. I was talking to my mom about how it feels like the 2020s don't really have a distinct style like previous decades did, but I think its mainly just "nostalgia". Wanting to return to a "simpler" and "happier" time. I think back on those things and realize it was mostly just me being a kid, being curious and excited about everything.</mark></p>

<p><mark>I think I've been in a period of mourning, and I think I know what I'm mourning; my younger self. I think I feel a great deal of pain for him. He was a creative child who was misunderstood and had to keep quiet about everything he liked. I feel angry for him, I feel angry no one stood up for him or bothered to listen to him. I feel angry people just used him as a pawn or nothing at all.</mark></p>

<p><mark>I also have come to terms its likely I may experience obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD) which, I'm still obviously doing alot of heavy research into. The main thing that has lead me to believe I have OCD is something called "rumination". Which is basically constantly revisiting an instruive/unwanted thought in an attempt to "solve it". Believing the discomfort means its some type of "sign" that its true. Which, I felt like when I read about the symptoms of things like that, like a big spotlight was put onto me. I get that alot, but it gets particularly worse with my seasonal depression.</mark></p>

<p><mark>One of my more frequent "ruminations" is about my own identity, particularly my gender. Its not that I don't believe I'm "ACTUALLY a man" (Trans) its more of "What if I'm secretly wrong? What if I'm just buying into a cult? What if I'm just a girl with internalized misgynony?". And then when I get the obvious dysphoria over it, I think "Well.. if it hurts to think about it must be true! The truth always has to hurt!" (Hint: Daydreaming about a life where you're a man since a very young age and ""humoring scenarios"" where maybe, just for a minute, you daydream about being a man, and how much you love men, is a sign.)</mark></p>

<p><mark>One thing that helps me deal with these types of thought spirals is trying to view it from a third person. (Using my dissociation to my advantage lol) And I think, well, no matter what trans people do, someone will always be upset with it. And just in general, no matter what you do, someone will be unhappy with the way you are.</mark></p>

<p><mark>I really don't feel like going thru the whole argument, maybe another day in another blog entry, but I recall a time when I was around 14-ish and I read some radical feminism things. I was mostly just curious as I was always told these people were bad and evil without much of a in-depth reason why apart from just basic "they're transphobic". And while I was reading it I just remember thinking.. "Wow, these are some vindictive people.." It was as if womanhood was a prison to many of these people. And, again, I had the "Well, the truth hurts to hear so it must be true.." And then I remember coming by this post on some randos blog, and it was a guy saying something about trauma. Something like "Going to therapy (something something) you can't become the person you were before". And I thought at the time it was very heartfelt. And the reply under it was this radfem blog going "I agree but.. ugh hate to hear it from a *man*." And in that moment it felt like I just lost all respect for believing anything this person had to say.</mark></p>

<p><mark>I think it should be really obvious the idea that "people (in this case, men) are born inherently evil/cruel" leads into so many harmful ideas and is just something that should not be humored at all. And you might say, "But Beau, what about the high rates of violence and imprisonment among men?" And to that I say, people are again not born evil. They are taught evil. Society has taught men that in order to get what they want, they need to be violent and "assertive". I'll write more about this another day.</mark></p>

<p><mark>And I thought about those types of people again, so of course I did some "research" to try and see if I could "find the truth". (Because *again*, yknow, "~The Truth Always Has To Hurt~") And it was something like "Well if theres no difference between men and women, why transition?" And I thought.. its funny how people know society, and gender within society, is a game. And they're mad that trans people can play it so well.</mark></p>

<p><mark>What I mean is, isn't it amazing we live in a time where we can begin to safely explore medicine relating to sex and hormones? That we have groups of consenting adults to test this medicine that is proven to help them feel happier within society? Doesn't that show that male and female aren't so far apart afterall? That the so-called border can be crossed? But to these people, no, I think its just simpler for them to imagine things one way. Because then that puts them on the same level as the different sex they hate.</mark></p>

<p><mark>I think part of the reason alot of anti-trans hate trans women, is because they see themselves in her in a way. They see someone, who they think is a "man", who by societies standards has everything handed to "him" on a silver platter. So called, "willingly throw it away" in order to "become a woman". Which to society, sees as "inherently weaker". And thats also where the accusation of fetishization comes in I think.</mark></p>

<p><mark>And when they see trans men transitioning, they think of a "weak woman" trying to become a "man". Trying to "become strong". And that scares them. The idea that anyone can become anything, that anyone can *become them*.</mark></p>

<p><mark>Theres alot more that goes into that but just something I thought about for a bit. So yes, male and female aren't far apart at all. But, yknow, theres not a big difference between a tank top and a short sleeve shirt. They keep you the same amount of cool most of the time. But jeez, isn't it nice to have choices?</mark></p>

<p><mark>So I guess to start wrapping up my thought process, I thought about how I was raised. I have alot of powerful and influental women in my life. The men in my life are god awful! My sister is a butch and military, my cousin is butch and a architech, my mom is a nerd and has done successful businesses, my aunt is funny and I have her taste buds, my cousins (Ok apart from *that one*) are sweeties. And I just think.. why? Why did I "give up" this sisterhood? I can't live as a woman, that'd be lying to myself. I'd be a fraud. And I can't do that.</mark></p>

<p><mark>You see radical feminists talk about how trans men are just "butches in denial". And I thought of that.. you're right, why can't I just be butch? Why am I basically a lesbian prodigy but still, somehow, I used to try and allow myself to "fantasize" about somehow swapping bodies with a man and living as him. Of being *loved* as a man, of being a son and a brother and a loving husband.</mark></p>

<p><mark>Ok, I'll save my man-loving rant for another day (I started getting red when I thought about writing beyond this point) but in a way, reading those posts, it just reaffirmed me in a way. You're right! I can't change! And its time for me to accept my manhood and masculinity!</mark></p>

<p><mark>I feel quite afraid of becoming an adult, theres alot of uncertainty and a big scary world to navigate. But I'm going to do it for him, for younger me. For younger me who felt afraid of telling my parents about a show I liked, for younger me who had to keep my music taste a secret because my parents would make fun of me, for younger me who felt afraid if my mom saw me select a male character in a game, or like I had no other choice. I'm going to make the choice of moving forward.</mark></p>

<h3><u><i><mark><font color="#9e001c">[November 18th 2023]</font></i></u></h3></mark>
<p><mark>Kind of tired of making these entries with "Wow, its been a while since I wrote!" since, well, whose really reading these? Not like its in high demand or something. Well, anyways,</mark></p>

<p><mark>Lately I've been feeling very mixed. I've had some pretty good days and some absolutely terrible ones. Some to the point I've spent a day just in bed under blankets because I don't want to exist. And some days it seems like they're fine but then they say something that reminds me of why I have that on edge feeling.</mark></p>

<p><mark>I try to just count the good things. A zine I drew for was just published, my art was featured in a pretty big texture pack, I wrote an application for something for next year, things are always looking up. But its hard to ignore. I should be happy, everything should be fine, theres no reason to be this upset is there? Should I even be upset? Can I be if I don't even really remember why? I mean, I think I know why. They say things I know isn't the truth, but is it really worth arguing over? And if its not, is it really true?</mark></p>

<p><mark>I just wish I could stop thinking for a while and forget. But I forget things so often except for the feeling. And now I'm just confused.</mark></p>

<p><mark>In good news, I recently revamped the index for the site. :] I'm very very happy with it. One night I went thru a old web musuem archive website (Thats a mouthful) and got really inspired. This took about 4 days or so. Its the happiest I've been with an index! This'll make further development much smoother. Next I'm going to rework the art section and make my Toontown shrine.</mark></p>

<p><mark>I'm drinking coffee right now. For some reason it clears my mind.  I think next I'll get out my iPod to listen to music while I do some achievement hunting on my Toontown account. Right now I'm working on gathering the remaining fish I need for some achievements. I already maxxed the level so I'm just missing a few.</mark></p>

<p><mark>I'm almost done cleaning all my media. My mom finally cleaned out the guestroom and wants me to move the games in there. So I've taken it as a chance to wipe them all out too.. The Wii games were the worst offenders so far, I've been thru two cans of lysol wipes..! But even if its really gross and I wash my hands with boiling water after, its a good feeling.</mark></p>

<p><mark>I'm getting different doors for my shelves soon, I need the top half to be glass so I don't have to dust my figures so often. I have a e-mail notifcation set up for it from Ikea.. its been a few days but hopefully soon. Its hard for me to organize the rest of my room with such a big glaring issue there.</mark></p>

<p><mark>Anyways, I feel a bit better after writing this. I've been getting bouts of stress lately. So much to do.. such little time. And I'll be turning 18 next year. I just want to feel like I'm worth something.</mark></p>
<hr>



<h3><u><i><mark><font color="#9e001c">[November 4th 2023]</font></i></u></h3></mark>
<p><mark>I keep meaning to write a new entry, but totally keep forgetting too. So better late then never :p</mark></p>

<p><mark>Halloween was very pleasant, I had a really terrible fatigue again between the last entry and now. But its lessening up on me. I feel the seasonal depression. But atleast this year it seems winter is kinder to my productivity. Whenever I vent about feeling upset I can't draw or code, I'm always told "Your worth doesn't depend on what you can do", something something capitalism. And while I agree, its not that I'm doing this for *other* people. *I* want to do things, I want to see my work finished, my only skill I feel is my art. Its kind of the core part of my identity y'know? (I get nightmares over losing my arms sometimes..)</mark></p>

<p><mark>Speaking of nightmares or weird dreams, I've been having a few. One was about home invasion, it was weirdly complicated but ended up just being funny by the time I woke up. The other I had just last night. Its kind of hard to describe, but I had a dream someone was compiling my art into a "cringe compilation" zine to make fun of me. That sounds really outlandish saying it outloud...- But I didn't feel really upset in the dream or when I woke up. It just felt normal to me. For some reason I feel like my brain is giving me commentary about how I'm my harshest critic or something, or how I'm so used to being walked on?</mark></p>

<p><mark>My room is totally in shambles right now.. Its been super cold at night where I am, and I'm more productive at nocturne. So I just wanna stay in bed.. My mom said she'd help me redo my dresser, so I took everything out for her on the floor. ..She complained she couldn't get it back in. I checked what she did and she folded them so they take up the entire damn thing and didn't bother combining some things together. (My socks and underwear and under shirt tanktops were all in the same drawer.. Why the hell did you put all the socks into their own drawer..!?) I think its funny she has an entire closet and I have some tiny one from the guest room and shes always mad at me for "having so many clothes I never wear". Its not that I'm ungrateful, I just wish my mom did some thinking sometimes..</mark></p>

<p><mark>Speaking of the guest room my moms finally cleaning it up from being our psuedo-storage room. She wants me to move all the gaming media in there so I'm cleaning EVERY game we own. ..I've been thru two lysol wipe containers... And nowhere near done. I only trust myself to make sure things are clean, she said she "cleaned" the VHS tapes but they still look filthy. ..Sorry I'm totally trash talking my mom and her lackluster in my opinion cleaning. I'll look back on this and laugh.</mark></p>

<p><mark>As for the website.. I'm slowly working on this again! I've been dedicating my time to my side project, <a href="https://crashboxdatabase.neocities.org">the Crashbox database</a>. (Its kind of presentable to mention now right?) But recently logged back into this one to redo my index. My index was a big point of procrastination for me. Originally I was going to have 3 seperate directories, one towards "personal", one towards "art", and the "help desk". But.. then I thought, wait, lol, no ones obligating me to do this. I can just renovate the personal page to also link to the other two. So I did :P I'm not entirely satisfied with the index, but its better then nothing.</mark></p>

<p><mark>Theres some more I want to rant about, like that fiction discourse blog entry I wanna do a deep dive on, and some entry about gender, but I'm already exhausted. I think I'll try to reorganize my clothes again and let my cat Mitts in since shes crying at my door (very pathetically) right now.</p></mark>

<h3><u><i><mark><font color="#9e001c">[October 20th 2023]</font></i></u></h3></mark>
<p><mark>Welcome back to another episode of "Beaus woes". Yesterday was just a accumulation of terrible things beating up my brain to where I spent most of today just sleeping. The sleep was really nice actually, atleast I don't have a headache anymore. I had to write down some things and it reopened some old wounds. I think I get over things and it turns out I just learned how to shove it down and not think about it.</mark></p>

<p><mark>I realize I have a hard time admitting when something hurts me, or if someone was being a bad person to me. I think I try to reframe every situation in my head into a personal failing on my behalf. Because then I think, "Well I can prevent it again in the future" even if its completely out of my control. It sucks being aware of these things and not knowing how to stop them even when you feel your brain working against you. But being self aware is better then not being I guess.</mark></p>

<p><mark>I'll be turning 18 next year in February. Birthdays are always a strange thing for me, I don't feel very different every passing year. I can tell I mature from my past selves, but I never feel like I really "grow up". I view my younger selves as seperate people then me, when I think of their memories its like I'm watching a movie. One of my earliest memories was one of my birthday parties. People were singing around me and I had a sensory overload and hid under the table haha. I always hated the attention like that. My mom once got me and my friend a cake with a cringy saying on it. "Its the thought that counts". Even if it made my spite of it more.</mark></p>

<p><mark>I won't really get into it, but basically I wasn't socialized right as a puppy. I'm pretty 50/50 about becoming "an adult". I know 18 year olds aren't really considered "adults" until you're about 20. But it doesn't stop my minor (haha age pun) anxiety about it. I feel like I wasn't told anything and now I'm expected to know these thousands of rules and norms and I have no leniency if I mess up. Like everyone else studied for a test I never was told about. I feel older then my family, I feel far too young for my peers. What game of "guess who" is this?</mark></p>

<p><mark>It feels really terrible to say, but when I was home alone from my parents for that week I felt alot better. I was eating consistently (And didn't feel immense guilt about it!), I was doing more things, I felt happier. Sure I was nervous about outside noises, I can't drive or go anywhere so I had a bit of that paranoid cabin fever, but I know in the future I'll have a roommate of sorts to make me feel better about that.. My parents have always been really weird about my "maturity". On one hand, I'm "sooo" much better then my peers. But on the other, sometimes they treat me like I'm too helpless to do anything by myself. Or treat me like my thoughts aren't complex or like I can have my own independent life one day.</mark></p>

<p><mark>I feel like a doll in a way. Locked in a glass cabinet just to be gawked at. I feel like that in public especially. I don't really like being around them in public and not in a "eww lol these are my parents" but in a "I don't know these people I wish I wasn't associated with these people" kind of way. God, I'm really starting to just let it out huh? Ok, I'll stop after this last paragraph. But they've always had this weird "Ohh you'll live behind us! :] You'll never leave us!" type of thing. They word it so innocently and happily but the thought of being trapped with them... makes me sick. I feel like I'll never get out of here. Ever since I was young I've visualized my house as more of a "bird cage" then a home. Its just a very cushioned cage that if I leave, I die. Thats most of my dreams. Leaving my house and something awful happening.</mark></p>

<p><mark>The idea of being an adult seems like alot of fun. I like the idea but it feels just so out of reach. Like I'll just be stuck as a dumb teenager for the rest of my life. When I was younger and envisioned my future, my family was never in it. Envisioning my parents in my future makes me feel really grossed out actually. Is that bad..? Is it selfish? Am I a bad person?? Whats the truth anyways? I just wish things were simple. And then the aspect of other adults.. I know theres kind of "levels" to adults (I've studied them!) and no one my age really knows what they're doing or something.. but I've always felt so out of touch from other people my age. Going to school, having friends, going over to friends houses, none of that. In a way I'm.. angry! I'm angry! I think I'm mad, actually! And I've never been allowed to feel angry. So I just feel nothing. I'm angry. I'm angry for the child I was that didn't get to have a sleepover with my friend that my mom kept evading, I'm mad for the child I was that had to hide their interests out of fear from his parents, I'm fuming for the child that had to think so early on to make myself "palatable" to the adults in my life, I'm furious that no one stuck up for me.</mark></p>

<p><mark>But its so easy to fall into anger. Its so easy to be mad. Its another reason why I don't let myself feel it, I think. I don't want to be my parents in that way. I don't want to fall into a blind mob of fury. I just want to feel okay, for once. I just want to notice the sun is shining today. I just want to hear laughter that doesn't make my skin crawl. Why do they make my skin crawl..? What have I pushed down for so long. I have such big memory gaps sometimes I forget if I showered today, or yesterday night.</mark></p>

<p><mark>I think my fear of being an adult comes from not wanting to live the rest of my life as a puppet under people. I don't know what I want fully, but I know I don't want that. I just want to turn into a dove and fly away. And eat berries or something...</mark></p>

<p><mark>The other day in the midst of my stress episode I reached the "If something else happens I think I'll just sit on the floor and start screaming" point. (Good friend of the blog, my internal demons) And it was over how people percieve me. I know we all have a version of ourselves in each others head. I think my SNS mutuals are funny and creative, I think this artist is cool, I like this guys music.. But theres a difference between idolization and "expectations", right?"</mark></p>

<p><mark>I think I'll try to word it like.. My parents want me to be someone else. I know they do. I know they're waiting for the day I drop the "trans charade" and become their lavendar child little girl again. But its never going to happen. They've always bargained with me to try and be a "lesser trans". To just be a "inbetween". I told my mom, about my grandma, that she doesn't <i>love</i> my mom. She "loves" an "idea" of a "perfect family" she made, and she needs my mom to play a part in her fantasy to keep herself happy. Its.. selfish. My grandma is selfish. I hate saying it, because it feels like I'm comparing my mom to my Very Much Greater Evil Grandmother, but I feel similarly. They just want me to play a part for them. I can't word it really, but its there. They just tolerate it.</mark></p>

<p><mark>But what happens the day I get a beard? The day my voice gets deep. Those.. are things <i>I</i> want. But my mom always tries to "guide me" away from these things as "Ohhh, wellll, they're just SO unknown!" And she tries to talk to me about how stupid and annoying <i>men</i> are. But, deep down, its what my heart desires. Its who I am in my soul. I've tried to push it down, I've tried to deny it, I've spent nights crying over it. And its not like they'd know that, they've never asked me. They've never asked me questions about my transness, <i>what do I want in life,</i> they just decide for me and <i>expect</i> me to follow it.</mark></p>

<p><mark>Why am I even talking about all of this? Isn't this too personal to air out on a dinky website like this? Well, yes.. But its real. "Theres a person behind every screen" I think is a sentiment alot of people forget. And like I said, its so easy to turn to blind hate and rage. Its so easy to just view other people as pawns and kings in a game of chess over stupid discourse. But I'm real. I'm affirming that, for me. I feel things, I think about things, and this site is a reflection of me. I guess thats why I get so mad at posers on here, but thats another story lol</mark></p>

<p><mark>Anyways, thanks for reading if anyone actually bothers reading this. I know its kind of cringe to be unironic on the internet in this day and age, but I suck at lying or keeping my trap shut. And I don't see any reason to lie about.. the truth. Yknow? Its the truth of what I feel and what I know. I'm not going to be gaslit anymore into being small and docile. I don't want to live the rest of my life like that.</mark></p>

<p><mark>Its a long life ahead of me, which is really scary. But I want to see it some day. I don't want this blog entry to come off as "Guyz i deed it i found the end 2 all meh suffering" because thats just simply.. not possible. But I guess acknowledging I can feel pain, and sorrow, and have emotions, is important right? Its a step for me atleast.</mark></p>
