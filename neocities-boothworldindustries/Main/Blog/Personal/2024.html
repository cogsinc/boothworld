<h3><u><i><mark><font color="#9e001c">[May 26th 2024]</font></i></u></h3></mark>
<p><mark>Its been a good while since I sat down to write a blog entry! I've been pretty busy and having alot of fun with Benjamin. But finally I've been able to sit down and be productive on my site and hopefully art again. My mental health has been up and down lately, but being around people who don't make me feel like styrofoam helps. You probably already know if you've been reading my profile statuses, but I installed Linux! I'm currently writing a blog entry about it, so I'll try to keep it to a minimum here, but I've been having so much fun and my only regret was not trying this sooner. As of last night I got all the programs I wanted to work fully on here. I've been craving to play Corporate Clash and I'm so relieved I got it to work thru Lutris. Unfortunately I've now been overcome with the urge to install Linux on every computer in this house and get my dad to give me his old chromebook. Computers feel fun again!!</mark></p>

<p><mark>If you can't tell I've just been bouncing off the walls with excitement. It feels like the sun is starting to shine, or that I can predict a nice forecast in my future. I felt like writing this on a impulse, I'm actually about to start adding a fun new feature to the home page after I finish this >:] maybe even two if the first one I wanna do goes thru smoothly. What else have I been up to..? Just brainstorming all the things I want to do. And also torturing my husband with how Linux works- My main issue however is that I get so many ideas I get overwhelmed by options I just don't do anything or something else entirely. Its like my brain has a "queue" and I can only feel a emotion and do a action separately. When I get really hyped over a drawing idea I just pace around my room.</mark></p>

<p><mark>As for real life events, I'm kind of mad at my mom again (Big surprise) we were working on my legal name change and shes like "Ohh I'm making this seem harder then it is" and don't get me wrong, I should obviously be involved in the legal process, but kind of funny my mom can't read thru a one page document easily to notice that we could use me being a dependent on taxes for years as proof that I've lived here. A few weeks ago she suddenly started acting like the beacon of web security, telling me about how she swapped to Protonmail (Even though I'd been telling her to do that for months) and how she uses the Duckduckgo browser. She gets this really weird childish pouty voice when I tried to explain to her that she should be using Firefox browser WITH the search engine. She got back into playing her MMO again and has largely been hard to talk to. When I tried talking to her more about Linux (Since shes interested (I think) in swapping her Win11 PC to it) she just was trailing off reading something else she was doing. Last night I sent her a photo of me getting Corporate Clash to run finally and I was telling her that her game has a Lutris installer we could try, and she just ignored me.</mark></p>

<p><mark>My parents always complain I don't spend time with them when its really been the opposite for years. When I was little, like 6-8, I used to try and schedule my mom to do schoolwork with me and she never went thru with it, and then put younger me into the responsibility of if she went to jail. When I'd try to play games or watch TV with my mom she'd flat out take a nap midway thru or just leave or be on her phone while I was asking her if she enjoyed it. And then she projects her "WhY ArE We AlwAsy On OuR PhOneS" onto me. I've tried like three times now to get her into Undertale or Deltarune since I thought it'd be right up her alley with RPGs. I went with my dad to the store to get earbuds, since mine had died finally, and I played Metallica thru the AUX and later he somehow had no idea I liked Metallica I think. I had a dream about him the other night I don't fully remember where a lady asked me if I liked my dad, and I nervously just kind of went "Well, hes a bit annoying." and laughed. A few months ago he started apologizing to me about vaguely "not being the best father" or something like that. And I thought, you had 18 years to notice this? On one hand better late then never, but we all just dance around the issue of whatever they did wrong. Which I know, and remember, but my mom tells me how "I remembered it wrong". When my aunt came to visit, I recalled a memory about something innocent (I think a song) and my mom was shocked I remembered that young. And my aunt said "Yea, children remember everything". So I don't think I'm the one with memory issues in this house atleast. Christ.</mark></p>

<p><mark>I haven't told my parents about who I'm dating, funnily the only person who knows is my cousin. And I don't think I ever will, or just not for a long time, which I never did with any of my departed partners. Knowing how god damn weird they were about my sister and their partners and how judgemental they can be, I think I'd end up on the news if they said something weird about him. Its not worth the stress or the anxiety I get whenever they mention one of my friends by name. I make it sound like my parents are some monsters but they're just really dense to a almost accidentally harmfully ignorant degree. I'm excited at the idea of leaving here someday. Most of the dreams I have are about being outside but then being chased or having to be followed by one of them.</mark></p>

<p><mark>I've really been into the works of Oingo Boingo and Danny Elfman recently. Actually- its all I've been listening to! I really want to make a shrine for them like my Alternative Radio page. Bad thing about getting new interests is now I want to retheme parts of my website.. I thought about redoing my blog index something like House of Leaves, Navidson records style.. Something like that. I'll figure it out once I finish the ~cool feature~ I mentioned earlier. I've been thinking about how I present myself online a bit recently, more in the sense of "What do I feel afraid of?". One phrase I've been thinking alot about is "You can do whatever you want for forever", which is usually said jokingly, but its true in a sense. I think alot about the sort of uncritical view many well meaning people have about "Well, if it makes someone happy, then who are we to get in the way of it?". Trying to let go of the need for validation from my mother, atleast a little, I start to think about what makes me happy. I like the idea of having some mysterious artist aura, but also I unfortunately cannot shut the hell up about things I like. And that, like, totally cranks the style. I've been seeing some really venomous people lately, or just so judgemental like my parents, I think "Maybe I just want to be happy, I'm so tired of hatred in the world" and yes that is quite a naive view, defining what "happiness" and "hatred" mean. But small ways matter I think, its annoying being polite online in a sense, because people like to take advantage of that. I bitched about it a while ago with people being annoying in my Tumblr ask box demanding graphics. So I guess theres a fine balance between being polite but taking no bullshit I need to harness. I was browsing thru some older Geocities websites the other night since I saw a really sweet one ran by a older trans woman. And I just felt sad in a sense of how things have changed, which makes me sound like a boomer, and I think nihilism is just way of coping, but I want to feel authentic I think is what I'm searching for. Theres no point of this ramble, this was largely about me being nervous to make a kin page. Sorry.</mark></p>

<p><mark>Behold, I did not fall to my victorian child body illnesses. I just have been burnt out with coding and drawing honestly, this month and past I've been spending catching up on games. Mainly Postal and Fortnite! I haven't had fun with a shooter in such a long time. The current theme is Greek mythology, its been alot of fun playing with my special someone.. I've played TF2 and Overwatch before and always get stuck in the support/healer roles, I just have that compulsion to make sure everyones healed. (I also find other people very incompetent but thats besides the point, I faced many harsh realities before I fully hit puberty) Its fun to finally just not feel any obligations to a role in a shooter. I also fixed up my Stardew Valley mods so I can play again for the 1.6 update.</mark></p>

<p><mark>I dyed my hair! I dyed it a nice deep red color (Not the orange kind of ginger) I also cut it a bit back. I'm really happy with the color, it'll do until I get to wear cool grey hair. I dyed it myself actually, this is the first time I ever did it myself. I was really nervous I'd somehow fuck up the bottle and spoil the whole thing, I did it over call with my sweet boyfriend.. ..Did I mention I have a boyfriend by the way!!! What!! No wonder people in relationships are pretensious. I bet you're all jealous about how talented and smart my darling is. Please <a href="https://bellringer.neocities.org/">go visit his website</a>, he works so hard on all his graphics (That I get to spectate graciously) and yell at him to update it more with his cool thoughts and writing >:[</mark></p>

<p><mark>My aunt has come to visit to help my mom with her business stuff, so we spent about a week cleaning the guest/media room. There was a mouse in there, that had been hiding in our stove apparently. I'm pretty mad, because I spend alot of time deep cleaning the kitchen and other rooms around the house; and I leave a small to-do list for my parents of things I can't do easily. Like cleaning the fridge, and the stove, and the microwave. And everytime, without fail, my mom goes "I don't need to clean that" if you atleast looked in there we wouldn't of had a mouse problem for who knows how long. Atleast we got a new stove, we've had the same one since we moved in about a decade ago.</mark></p>

<p><mark>I had a bit of a episode within the past few weeks, just alot of "one of those days" that turned into multiple "one of those" days. One thing I've been grappling with, apart from hating this time of month due to personal reasons, is just how I was treated before. I'm quite mad I can't spend the rest of my life rotting away in my bed, now that I know theres people out there waiting for me; and how I don't want to disappoint them. Verbalizing things helps me in many ways but its also hard since I feel I lack a real inner self at times. Like I get really annoyed at the idea people think I'm some goody-two shoes. I got really peeved a while ago with a few people approaching me acting all friendly n shit, it was really creepy. I'm trying to let myself enjoy feeling happy, and not beat myself up over my righteous suffering. Its a foreign feeling, but I feel like a nerd.</mark></p>

<p><mark>I found out one of my favorite songs, "Angry Johnny" by Poe, was written by the sister of the author for "House Of Leaves"! And that one of her albums, "Haunted", is a complimentary piece to the book. What a small world we live in and what a fun connection one of my favorite musicians is related to the author of one of my favorite books. Anyways, I've been listening to "Haunted" more and I really like "Hey Pretty", particularly the 2001 edit at the end of the album with the snippets from the book. But I really like the ending fades with "Do you get the gist of this song now?". Her voice is hypnotic.</mark></p>

<p><mark>As if my guardian angel has a sick sense of humor, it seems whenever I feel upset something really nice has to happen, and I'm starting to feel that this year is shaping up to be one of my best years of my life so far. And its not even Easter yet. I'm worried about accidentally triggering some karma by mentioning how happy I am, but I am absolutely basking in it right now. Its somehow better then I could have imagined.</mark></p>

<p><mark>I started talking to my cousin (The only good one) again, I haven't talked to her in years! And yet it feels like seeing a old friend again. I finally got to tell her about one of my first memories being us playing Toontown together. My best friend performed at a pretty big concert. The man of my dreams loves me. I've been having a pretty rough time going to sleep lately, but now my dreams just feel funny since something better awaits me when I'm awake. For once I don't want to fall asleep early.</mark></p>

<p><mark>For once I feel like my relationships are stable, and I'm sure there will be hard times again. But I'm going to let myself enjoy something for once. I feel like I deserve it after all the bullshit I've been put thru in my teens. Being an adult doesn't feel so scary sometimes. If I could tell my younger self something it'd be: Dump them sooner. But then again, that experience wouldn't have lead to where I am now. But don't be mistaken, I'm not applauding those assholes.</mark></p>

<h3><u><i><mark><font color="#9e001c">[March 24th 2024]</font></i></u></h3></mark>
<p><mark>I rewrote the introduction to this entry a few times, I don't know why I exactly feel obligated to do that. It kind of defeats the whole purpose or something. But once more I return to my public diary to bitch and moan, and talk about the new coffee maker my mom got recently. (And how cool it is)</mark></p>

<p><mark>This month or so I have just been in a constant up and down of depression and borders on mania in some areas. I get a ego boost and it deflates. I think "I don't need anyone or anything, I'll run out into the world and make it my bitch" and the next hour I think "I'm broken inside". I'm kind of mad, depression is meant for November, not the middle-end of March. I think perhaps I'm just in a reminder of how outsider I am to groups, but everyone likes to think they're special. And clearly cynicalism too I have. I just feel constantly jaded and almost melanchonic with everyone around me. I feel like I put effort into things (or people) that bear no fruit, and I have no one to blame but myself for thinking it'll be different this time. But the whole "nothing I do matters" thing kind of circles back around into calming me down. Sometimes I fear the type of person I am in my head, I get the whole really bad "you'll manifest your thoughts if you think about them too hard" thing. Which can be true sometimes, but I should clarify I'm talking about irrational paranoia. I really hope the whole boring depression thing goes away so I can laugh at myself again. The worst part about feeling detached from yourself is I can't work on my art either. So I can't even be a woeful poet people idolize in like 200 years.</mark></p>

<p><mark>It feels like more lately people have been infantalizing me in a way. My parents talk to me in this weird cheery voice that makes me feel like a cartoon character. And some people in a server I'm in have this weird parasocial relationship with me sometimes. I had to put a disclaimer thing in my Discord bio like a "don't trespass" sign. Its not that I don't like being friendly towards people, it just feels like I'm the only sane person sometimes. I don't know if its something about how I present myself that people think I'm some ray of sunshine, or maybe its just everyone else. I'm kind of like that one Simpsons episode with the guy who starts to go insane over how Homer acts. (Whenever I'm sad I do a Mr. Burns impression) (It hasn't been working lately) (I need to try rewatching Reverend Burns again) I'm not having a "I hate everyone my age" type thing, I just think I'm having some misanthropy. Which is almost freeing in a sense, thinking "it is what it is". Funny how it circles back around into almost being positive.</mark></p>

<p><mark>I've been feeling really tired lately even though I've been going to bed earlier. I just sleep in when I wake up early, I hear peoples voices and just think "I'm really not presentable right now". Like if people look at me they'll see the seams holding my skin together like a layer beginning to fray. I don't even really feel actively upset most days, just mildly annoyed and thinking "oh boy, what next." I had two days recently that just had bad luck back to back. Like missing out on something by a day, the two foods I wanted being out of stock (Like my ramen, I started to boil the water and the box containing them was empty.) and then when things started looking up and I got myself a treat, I tripped and banged the ever living shit out of my knee. (It was a week ago and theres still a huge bruise there.) So I'm just like, whats next, is a piano going to drop on me? In good news atleast, I got some fun new games from the Steam spring sale. (One of which I want to write a article about.)</mark></p>

<h3><u><i><mark><font color="#9e001c">[March 7th 2024]</font></i></u></h3></mark>
<p><mark>I meant to write a blog entry on the last day of February, with something like "hehe I'm gonna sneak in one more entry before the month ends!" but funnily now its a week into March. But in all honesty I haven't had much *to* blog about. Or I haven't really felt the need to in a way, for reasons. But I realize now in a bout of depression I'm having, its probably a good idea to make myself verbalize things again. Or just have something to look back on for when I'm feeling depressed to remember when times weren't that bad.</mark></p>

<p><mark>I made a cleaning to-do list the other day, and managed to clean about 3 rooms in one day! My room, my bathroom, and the hallway. It all went pretty great and I felt pretty proud of myself. I did everything, vacuumed under my rug, washed my curtains, cleaned all my eletronics, took everything out of the shelves to be wiped down and up. My knees hurt pretty bad towards the end of the day, but I felt better once I laid down finally. I've been trying to make myself do some more exercises too, and incorporate it as a part of my nightly routine. (Or morning routine depending on when I wake up and if I need to do anything that day). I really recommend the <a href="https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PL0Af0VuX-9FCQqvAfSK1_tWq3UWeJsRmx&si=Y3songoRUwVI3ipw">LEAP service gentle exercise</a> playlist. I'm admittedly not the most active person due to circumstances, so it helps alot.</mark></p>

<p><mark>The next day, immediately after cleaning and feeling great, we got some really crummy weather. And it seems everyone I know did too. I made a joke that it was because I used up all my "good karma energy" on cleaning and being motivated, but I'm honestly starting to think its the truth.. The weathers been on-and-off lately. One day it'll be utterly misreable and I can't do anything, and the next day its super sunny. Today is a very nice day, but I still feel depressed. I went to bed early, woke up early, and yet decided to sleep in anyway for no real reason besides I just didn't want to face anyone yet. I mean, I can't act its totally unreasonable, I'm having a pretty rough time with memories, but it is what it is.</mark></p>

<p><mark>I had a pretty good drawing spike recently, I've been trying to get over my whole "perfect lineart" thing. So I did some experimentation by doodling the Litigation Team from Corporate Clash in my own style and outfits. (You should see them on the art page soon.) I'm pretty proud of it honestly, I feel like my style is developing a bit again. But I'm still sad, 3 months into this year and I still feel like I haven't done anything worth while. I realize I'm pretty slow when it comes to drawing, which is making me compare myself alot to other people. I'm slightly falling back into a SNS mentality with how frequently I post art, I think I might try to detox for a bit soon.</mark></p>

<p><mark>Speaking of game news, Corporate Clash is going to have a major Boardbot update tomorrow. I'm gonna tier some Project Sekai tonight, since the event ends on the 9th.. I only remember the days for Project Sekai tiering it seems lol. I have a few articles I've been meaning to write on Toontown, one is a heavy draft and the other I need to research more. I really need to get over my anxiety of "But what if I'm wrong and stupid" when it comes to my opinions, <s>because I've seen plenty worse lately.. Thats me being salty, sorry.</s> Someone dear to me got me into Fortnite recently, because it has a rhythm game mode. And I'm utterly obsessed right now with Pat Benatars "Heartbreaker", so I was itching to try it. The battle royale mode is really fun too, but maybe its because I got to play with him.. But that reminded me, and made me want to try out Guitar Hero again! I'm playing the Definitive Edition mod. I had some technical diffculties with it, but I got to play Heartbreaker finally. I'm gonna look into how to mod it soon with custom models, and maybe try out custom songs. But I totally suck at it right now, its a little more hand-eye cordination then I'm used to, but all rhythm games are just muscle memory.</mark></p>

<p><mark>I'm glad I ended up deciding to write this, I feel a bit better in that I guess I have been doing some stuff. My parents are going away to visit my aunt on the 13th for a few days, I'm gonna try to do some house cleaning and maybe some other things while they're gone. Since they won't be in my way while I'm cleaning, and I can listen to music loudly! Speaking of which, I've been meaning to work on my iPod mod article.. Maybe I'll work on that next. I'm just a little mad all my hobbies seem to include me sitting down >:/</mark></p>


<hr><h3><u><i><mark><font color="#9e001c">[February 19th 2024]</font></i></u></h3></mark>
<p><mark>Recently I tried making a "months to do list" to try and motivate myself to see how much I can get done during the month. I'm kind of upset I couldn't really finish half of it this month- but I've been kind of stressed out and just plain tired. When I tell people, its like they don't understand I really *want* to do things, but executive dysfunction and headaches keep kicking my ass. I've also been thinking alot about the passage of time, and realize I do have quite a bit of time.. Atleast rereading my blog entries, or looking at old art pieces I drew with their dates attached, I think "That felt like a while ago.." which is pretty reassuring in a way.</mark></p>

<p><mark>The 6th was my 18th birthday I keep talking about in the previous entries. I feel kind of relaxed about it in a way, its kind of like I just got given a bunch of admin priviledges lol. But still, I feel like I'm being thrust forward into the future without anyone in my real life really respecting me in a way. I feel like a kid constantly incapable of anything. My mom told me this whole spheel while she was watching some Gypsy Rose documentary that she doesn't want me to feel "held back" by her. And I appreciate the sentiment, but I just thought "You had 18 years?" and then she says how shes gonna "leave me alone" now. I just want to rip myself away from her and the constant comparisons she makes between us. When will I get to be my own person.</mark></p>

<p><mark>My birthday was pretty fun, I went to a store and got a bunch of second-hand CDs and went to ihop. :] I was home alone for a bit before we left so I spent some time trying out masculinzing makeup techniques, which turned out good in my opinion. I also figured I can stuff socks in my shoulders to broaden them a bit, which made me feel really happy. My legal name change process we're going to start on soon-ish, my parents are doing some legal shit in relation to the house. Its a little complicated, but I think I got the general process down. I think the main issue is just my parents trying to find my birth certificate lol. But hopefully once thats done, I can actually start living my life in some way. Like having my own money might help me feel more respectable. But also, I keep thinking about money and how much I utterly hate it. I was thinking the other day, in the car, something like "I hate everywhere I go involves some type of purchasing" like hanging out in stores or resturants. Once you notice it its hard to ignore.</mark></p>

<p><mark>My birthday, my mom had to be weird about it. Sorry for the "mom rant" jumpscare again, but I just always have such mixed feelings on her. Its like one day she suddenly says a bunch of really good stuff and seems like she respects me, then the next day I'm back to being a dumb kid or shes in a bad mood and I have to be careful around her. And she has the thought to ask "Why do you seem depressed?" but never really ask herself why. She tried getting me to take photos with her, and I have a pretty hard "no photo" rule. I just don't like when other people photograph me, I always hated being in family photos because I just didn't like being next to other people. I forgot some of what happened honestly, but it went something along the lines of her saying "Well *I* wish I had more photos of me and *my* dad, its *important to you*" and I said "How do you know whats 'imporant to me'? Its my birthday, I'm not *comfortable* with being photographed." And she tried what she did last year with trying to open my car door (Because I'd go out early to avoid the photos) and then gave me the deafening angry silence.</mark></p>

<p><mark>It feels like my parents "take over" things in alot of senses. Recently I started feeling uncomfortable even with my own name, Beau, because it felt like my parents took it over into their own little "learning experience" and like I'm back at my birth name in some weird way. Its like no matter what I'm just morphed into some doll for people for their convience and never truly taken seriously. Even with the cake, when they were cutting it, I just wanted to cocoon in on myself because I hate being seen by *them*. I told my mom I didn't really want it photographed and I just wanted to eat it, and she basically shoved me out of the way to do it. I hate what they see, because I know its not really me. And I get it, its cool to think "huh wow this person I gave birth to is older now" but at a point I feel like a prize pagent pig.</mark></p>

<p><mark>My mom says she wants to go visit my aunt in another state in March. And it had me thinking again, of when they went over to Utah and I was home alone for a week. How different I felt. It was like suddenly I was really productive, I was doing things! I was cleaning, maintaining the house, hanging out with my cats, working on my site even(!!!) and I was eating more too. And even when I looked in the mirror I just felt.. neutral. I felt anxious about being alone, sure, with no one to really physically talk to for a week. But I felt strangely free and happier. And then when they came back, its like it started all over again. Like the lights got dimmer again suddenly. When I'm around them the world feels scarier and darker. Its like I'm stuck here. Everything I do physically has to involve them, and I can't tell them that part of the big reason I don't like doing stuff irl is because of that.</mark></p>

<p><mark>On the brightside, I'm pretty excited at the idea of being home alone again soon. I'll probably try to do a big cleaning while they're gone, along with the rest of the media shelf. Sometimes I'm a little mad when I clean the house because it feels like my parents half-ass cleaning it in return. But I want to lighten things for my mom, and I don't want my cats breathing in dust. Right now I think I'm just going to draw. Sorry there isn't alot of site updates, a bit burnt out doing the "gifts" and "neighborhood" page back-to-back. But I do have plans for some things! Like a new clique >:]</mark></p>

<h3><u><i><mark><font color="#9e001c">[January 25th 2024]</font></i></u></h3></mark>
<p><mark>I woke up early today. :D Well, I more of forced myself to stay awake. But slowly my sleep schedules been fixing itself for the spring, which I'm very happy about. My productivitys been coming back too. Hooray, now I just have regular depression. I got a small bout of it today, randomly, but I think I should eat first before I start seriously contemplating my emotions. Anyways, I'll try not to bore anyone with the talk about my mental state. I decided to try and move my shower time to the morning instead of night, since it wakes me up more. And my hair finally curls out properly.</mark></p>

<p><mark>I finished my main art page, and now its optimized for me to easily add more entries. :] I have no idea why I like to invent new medevial torture devices when I code. I also started looking at cliques today! You'll notice some new ones on the index. I'm considering making my own.. but its still in the heavy planning phases. Up next on my to-do list is to just keep working on the art page honestly. And then onto the photo album page and OC pages.</mark></p>

<p><mark>Next month is my birthday, I'll finally be turning 18. I'm really nervous about the whole thing, like I've rambled about before. My moms gonna help me with getting a legal name change, so the aspect of going up to a judge is pretty nerve wrecking. Do people think "Beau" is a androgynous name? It literally means "boyfriend/male lover" in French. Oh well, I just hope I can change my last name too. And my middle name! Thats right, I even got a new middle name allll planned out. Sad none of you are ever gonna see it, I'm not that personal on my website. >:P</mark></p>

<p><mark>But also, just mentally in general, its kind of a weird thing. Its like I suddenly feel like I have all this power, or something, and I should do something with it? I asked my mom the other day if this meant the IRS was suddenly gonna start taxxing me and I'm gonna go to jail for not having money lol. I've never felt like my peers my age, age and "maturity" has always been a strange thing to me and how I feel treated. I just hope it'll be easier then I think it is to where I don't even notice. Now I just have to survive until my 20s, which is for some reason when everyone goes batshit insane again. Whats worse, being 12 or 23? I'm about to star in the new mythbusters episode on the matter.</mark></p>

<p><mark>Its a surprisingly nice day despite it being utterly misreable outside. I'm kind of freaked out I lost my 3ds (Nothing is more valuable to a boy then his x readers on AO3 I have saved on there!!) but its probably somewhere knocked behind my bed that I don't feel like fishing out right now. My mom has some new meals from this thingy she ordered, shrimp pie or something, so I have pretty high hopes for that. Y'know, I think I'm just gonna play Toontown for the rest of the day. Almost maxxed my Sellbot suit, I'm kind of pissed I died last night near the very end of the C.E.O... (I should've used a bigger unite to save my rat ass!!!) I kind of finished all the tasks I wanted to today.. (Finish art piece and the main page - hey you should go check that out) So. Hm. I think I'll just relax actually. What a odd feeling.</mark></p>

<p><mark>I woke up late today, and I was just getting good! >:/ I woke up at 10 AM yesterday, and slept in until 3 PM today. Ugh. Well when I do that it tends to give me some pretty funny vivid dreams. I've been meaning to start writing them down, I heard that helps you lucid dream better. My problem is when I realize I'm dreaming I get so excited I wake up.</mark></p>

<p><mark>The first dream I had was when I fell asleep earlier that night (And.. woke up and stayed up too late because I thought the time would disperse so I'd wake up at 10 AM again..) it was very vivid but it was a house. My house. No not the house I live in currently. I mean *my* house one day in the future. It was really warm looking, it was like one of those little joint house apartment things. I had someone over, a (dream) boyfriend, and I asked him to help me turn on the lights in the house since we had been out all day and I was nervous about the dark. (..I do have a minor phobia of dark spaces) And then I woke up. It was a really nice dream, I don't get those often.</mark></p>

<p><mark>The second dream was a little more upsetting. I was making something in the toaster, but it wouldn't pop back up properly and since it was stuck it started to catch on fire. In my dreams when I try to yell or scream, for some reason my voice doesn't come out. Same with punching and attacking something, its like at the last second I go weak. Anyways, I remember then my dad(?) telling me to throw it outside, so I did. And I'm out there with it, its not a full fledged fire but just this kind of smoking mess. I'm trying to find a hose, and I went out the backdoor mind you so I'm in the backyard, and my mom comes out the backdoor to kinda yell at me? Shes like yelling at me about how there is no fire or something, when there clearly is.</mark></p>

<p><mark>My mom has always been a bad force in my dreams since I was young. Usually there to yell at me or make me feel scared. I often times have dreams where I have a different mom entirely. I once had a dream some odd years ago I was in a supermarket with this nice lady, she had orange-red curly hair and was really nice to me. And when I woke up I felt sad she wasn't my mom. I worry about the implications of stuff like that, its a very common theme in my dreams.</mark></p>

<p><mark>So that dream ends kind of weirdly in a way I don't fully recall- but it was like my dad knew there was a fire but just let my mom yell at me about it. And I was just outside sitting there on my knees with this burnt toaster. And eventually I went back inside, and this is the part of when your dreams are ending that things stop making sense/are less rememberable. But I remember something about someone being outside?</mark></p>

<p><mark>The last dream I had was I was shopping with my mom in this sort of Costco/Toysrus combo. And I was looking for specific figurines that were in the.. vegtable aisle? Something absurd like that. And we were walking to this help desk, and this is where the Toysrus aspect comes in more, it was like those game display cases and I remember thinking "Oh I haven't seen those in years, its nostalgic." (< Chat does he know?) And the lady at the desk was taking 30 years to find the aisle we were looking for. The computer she was using, the screen, displayed on a wall nearby and I watched her start searching how to block out other search results?? And I look over to my mom, whose on the phone, and shes talking to my aunt about personal stuff I won't put here. But now that I'm awake, I do wonder if a part of a conversation she was having normally somehow bled into my dreams. Since she talks to my aunt on the phone all the time, and her office is across from my room.</mark></p>

<p><mark>Anyways so we leave the lady and finally I find what I was looking for out the corner of my eye along with webkinz. (Like a really HUGE purple bear, and this deer that changed colors from the lighting) And the ending of the dream is us checking out at this front desk thing. But the cashiers are like, convention nerds? It was like a anime convention desk. And I remember this guy walking up to being near my mom and I walked inbetween them because I was mad at this guy for kind of hitting on my mom. And the dream ends when we finally finish checking out.</mark></p>

<p><mark>I mentioned earlier I woke up late today, my moms really mad about these motorcycle noises outside. And they are pretty annoying, and loud, but I tend to drown out most noise anyway so it doesn't bother me so bad. But my mom keeps going on about how she wants to go out there to yell or something, and I'm sure shes partially just venting. But I always feel like my moms really unpredictable? And it makes me antsy about her. I don't want to have to be the person to stop my mom from trying to fight strangers like we have to sometimes with my dad. I just don't get why middle-aged people (Not even the elderly are as bad!) get so high strung about everything. I don't want to be like that. Its such a small thing to be mad at and I'm only bothered when my cat gets afraid. And I just pet her then.</mark></p>

<p><mark>I've been feeling a bit better physically since my last entry. I've been trying to do more exercise since its really cold outside where I live. Mentally I feel a little bit numb again, its just nature I guess. Recently my package from Japan came! Its been a bit since I've ordered anything. I mainly got a bunch of CDs, like Project Sekai and Meiko Nakahara. I also got a little lot of Malice Mizer VHS tapes that came with their postcard inserts. I'm a bit afraid to play them- fine china n all. I also got New Jeans "OMG/Ditto" album in a little lot with a Twice album and some other group- I like expanding my music horizons. I'm one of those hipsters that likes to say I "like a little of every genre" (except for the songs I don't like, teehee)</mark></p>

<p><mark>I'm just glad my productivity is back and I can work on things again, even if my sleep schedule is messed up. I slept in until 3 PM today, ew. So I haven't been feeling great in that way. I'm excited to eat dinner later and get back to working on the site. Planning on trying to go to bed at around 2-3 AM tonight. I can't fall asleep before 11 PM or else I'll wake up at like 5 AM. So annoying.</mark></p>

<p><mark>Last night my dad helped me set up my VCR and PS3 in my new room, we need a HDMI cable for the Wii. But really happy I can finally watch my tapes I've been cleaning again! I desperately want a little CRTV, I used to have a Spongebob one. But my parents constantly yap about how it'll hurt my eyes and whatnot. I'm still not over my mom convincing me to give my amazing VCR/DVD combo player to her friend she doesn't even really like.. Anyways, they're kind of arguing today. They say they aren't arguing, for my sake I assume, but they aren't happy with each other for whatever reason. My dad is kind of a asshole. I mean, he always is by default, but when hes being bitchy towards my mom I just want to slap him for acting like that. I don't know what their deal is all the time. I don't think they flat out hate each other but just, jeez, can my dad stop acting so childish and my mom so persecutory of everyone. And can they stop pretending I don't know? Its like I'm a adult as a child, but a child when I am a adult.</mark></p>

<p><mark>I have been thinking about my kin again. I think I may consider making pages for them.. I don't think I'll include things like my past life memory logs, or alot about my meditation, just because I think that part is unneccessary and personal. But also, I don't want anyone taking my memories as their "headcanons" or someone from a source of mine saying they know me and my memories "influence" their own. Thats why I meditate to instrumentals instead of songs with lyrics, to prevent anything influencing them. But, anyways. It'll probably be a while before I really make anything major for that. I don't want it to be a huge focus of the site, I'm currently focusing more on my art page since its, kinda like, my whole other hobby thing. Yknow the other thing I do when I'm not coding? Yea that. Thats important right? It is to me atleast.</mark></p>

<p><mark>I suck at writing introductions, but reason for long gap in entries is that I did actually write something before this. I just wrote it at 3 AM and started rambling and oversharing lol. But don't worry this ones actually a relaxed entry.</mark></p>

<p><mark>I went to the eye doctor recently to update my prescription and get new frames, its been about 2-ish years or so. My mom also got her eyes checked since shes having problems doing work at her computer. The eye doctor people were really nice as my mom actually went out of her way to find people that won't use medevial torture devices on us. I mentioned it in a really really old blog entry thats long been deleted, but in about September of 2022 I wanna say, I went to Sams Club for a eye appointment and it was honestly one of the worst experiences I've ever had at the eye doctor. The other worst was when I was like 5 getting my glasses for the first time and the eye drops hurt so badly I refuse to get them again. But, anyways-</mark></p>

<p><mark>So we did our appointments at the same time and mine wasn't really special. But my mom got some tea tree oil to clean her eyelashes and they gave me some too. After the third wash or so I got a really weird.. allergic reaction? One of my eyes was just itchy, and I've never ever had anything like that happen with my eyes. So I haven't used that again on my eyelashes, but it is really nice facewash alongside my normal stuff :p</mark></p>

<p><mark>And of course, near all our doctor stuff (Since we have to leave my town) is this really great second hand store. I won't say the name- You don't get my secret store >:p But its kind of a pawn shop mixed in with new stuff? I got a Aespa album and some new things since they had a clearance sale, and I got this Who Framed Roger Rabbit OST/audio drama thing?? I'm really excited to listen to it after I clean it. (And.. the rest of the media shelf...) I wanna make a shrine for WFRR really badly since its my top five favorite films.</mark></p>

<p><mark>I'm kind of mad. I was really productive doing stuff for my site and for art. And then I got my period, which, completely kicks my ass. I've always had really painful ones that totally sap the life force out of me for the week. I don't think I have PCOS or any specific hormone disorder, I think my problem is just that I'm kind of under developed and don't produce enough of anything in general lol. Plus its been winter, and seasons changing messes with my entire state of being. Honestly it also makes me worried about working in the future- in the case I have to get a job somewhere (I mean a physical one, because me and my mom agreed I am *not* physical working material for many reasons) but even then like.. God, I know its just about 3 days out of the month I spend feeling like shit. But it still feels like too many. I took birth control for a bit when I was younger, but it made me feel weird and depressed and not like myself. So I'm just trying to remind myself to drink more of my vitamin shakes and hope for the best.</mark></p>

<p><mark>Another thing I constantly worry about is my parents health and their money and things like that. And its mainly from my hatred of the US healthcare system. Which, trust me, I'm not just saying I/Americans hate it as a meme. My mom has IBS and some other issues I won't get into but she went to the hospital one night and they didn't even really tell her she had IBS- she just kind of figured it out herself. And then- ugh- my worst fear. Drawing blood and getting stupid nurses who have no idea what they're doing. The amount of horror stories I can't even begin to count of people I know getting nurses blowing out their veins. Eugh!!! Makes my skin crawl, one of my phobias. Its one of the many reasons I'm afraid of doctors. I'm not too afraid about in the future getting HRT- or atleast I hope I'll be able to stand up for myself if they want to try giving me an idiot who can't draw blood properly. Its not even that I'm really afraid of needles! I've been numbed before in my gums (by my Very Nice And Cool Dentist - not sarcasm) its just.. I don't wanna do this more then I have to!! Thanks!! And that shit DOES hurt if you're doing it wrong!! And then they're so condescending about your pain too! >:/</mark></p>

<p><mark>Apparently, recently the artist behind "Dance For Hours A Day" was found. :D Being a band named "Royal Treatment Plant". I'm totally gonna be a hipster about them. I really like their songs "You Don't See Me" and "Pricey". But otherwise, mentally, I've actually been doing really good all things considered. My sleep schedule is forcing to both fix itself and fuck itself up from my cramps. I've been feeling really happy lately actually.. you don't get to know why!! This is ruining my ominous image!!</mark></p>

<h3><u><i><mark><font color="#9e001c">[January 1st 2024]</font></i></u></h3></mark>
<p><mark>I got around to my first new years resolution today, which is working on the site again. :] I feel better when I do something on here, or draw. The seasonal depression I think is slowly leaving me, now I'm just back to regular depressed and fatigued! Yay...</mark></p>

<p><mark>I know people say things like "Don't make unrealistic or big expectations for the new year", and I have to agree in a way. But I always feel like I should've accomplished something more by now at my age. I could be studying medicine or something but I'm just in my room. But I hate being so self pitiful, everytime I feel a negative emotion like that I get this fear I'm turning into the people who I resent. But I try not to bottle it up, its better then what else I could be doing right now.</mark></p>

<p><mark>Sometime next month it will be about 3-4 years since I last harmed myself. I predict I'm probably going to regret saying that, not even my family knows that and I'm telling it in my public journal I do to minorly get over my fear of public speaking. I feel like I should feel something more for that. Proud? Like I made progress? I just feel largely indifferent. And I feel tired and guilty of not feeling anything when I should. I think I learned sometime ago that no one cared then, and it doesn't seem many people care now. And I mean, in a way, I don't expect other people to care. We all have something going on, its selfish to demand affection. But its like everytime I try to be helpful or vulnerable to other people I just feel like a clown. I think everyones afraid of being close or honest. So yay for me I guess?</mark></p>

<p><mark>I will say this year is better then the last. Last year I spent the night crying at my desk while pathetically eating a peanut butter and jelly sandwich! And this year I got some new stuff coming from Japan and I went to bed early. ..Well I had a migraine. But still, I woke up early and feel pretty good physically. I've been having problems eating again, I don't have any appetite or even much hunger. But I know my body needs food, so I've just been eating toast and bagels alot lately lol. To anyone reading this, you should try strawberry cream cheese. Its really good!</mark></p>

<p><mark>Earlier, my mom said to me that even since I was young I constantly would apologize for everything. And when I was really little I hid away when I'd injure myself. Its weird my mom recognizes "odd" behaviors I have but can't seem to think that.. maybe she and my dad did some things when I was younger that hurt me emotionally. Because only until recently have I felt a deeper bond to my mom. And I mean in a way that happens with every kid and their parent, they mature and age and get closer. But when I was younger I remember seeing my parents just as authority and scary and like I had to be careful. I just always had that feeling and I still do now.</mark></p>

<p><mark>I don't like watching TV with them, they just make it so.. not awkward, but just weird. They say weird things that make me go "???". Or just generally unenjoyable. Just the aura they bring I don't jive with. And I feel bad about that, I wish I had a more deeper bond with my parents. I feel safe around them but not really happy. I still think alot about the time they left the house for a week and I started to feel so happy and like I was.. stable? This house feels like a box. My sister doesn't message me as much and I understand why.</mark></p>

<p><mark>Well, parental issues aside. I have another big issue I'm sure no one will be reading because I bored them with all of that. ..For the first time in 4 years or so, I think I have a actual crush on somebody. I don't know how to really feel about that. Its like my heart is flickering and restarting and I can feel it beat in my chest for once. I feel warm and nervous and like I can feel the veins in my hands and the humming of every light around me powered by it. I feel alive, and I don't like that. I feel guilty everytime I get these little crushes on people. I feel like a pervert even though all I imagine is just holding hands and sitting in silence. I wish I could tear it out and throw it over a mountain. I feel so stupid! I feel like such a coward. And he doesn't deserve a coward.</mark></p>

<p><mark>I have to say though its a issue of my own making. When I'd meditate I'd wish for a lover of some kind, I didn't ask for it to be so unrequited.. they say to be careful for what you wish for and the karma Gods want to make an example out of me lately. God! When I get like this I feel like I'm 13 again before my feelings were stomped into a million pieces. Do I have high standards or have I just been treated poorly for so long I think thats what love is? Just me quietly admiring someone. Those types of things only exist in fairytales. Its not real for someone like me.</mark></p>

<p><mark>I'm not getting my hopes up about it, even if it makes me feel.. things I forgot I could feel. I hate this, it makes me want to be a better person and like I have motivations to impress. I don't want someone to "fix" me thru loving me, I just like to imagine someone who listens to me I can give my love to. Someone that actually appreciates it anyway. God! God. God why.</mark></p>
