<h2 style="background-color: rgb(82, 107, 79); color: rgb(212, 211, 201); text-align: left;"><i>Installation, Cinnamon, spilling Wine</i></h2>
<p>I have been the unproud owner of a Windows 11 laptop for about 2.5ish years now. I regularly have stated how much of a bastard child this poor laptop is to me, and every step of the way in using it has had me sticking my tongue out and crossing my arms like a child being subjected to vegetables. Although that hatred has been increasingly more justly founded, with even non-tech-savvy users complaining of the recent AI practices Microsoft has been pushing, the security nightmare of co-pilot, bloat clogging system resources, and of course the infamous update system.</p>
<p>I originally researched Linux sometime last year at the recommendation of some friends, but finally took the plunge May of this year. My two choices were between Mint and Ubuntu, and I settled on Mint since it seemed like a more natural selection for me. I spent about 2 days backing up my files on my storage USB, and an extra day waiting for my webring e-mail password to reset itself. (<s>This is the second time I've forgotten my webring e-mail but I swear its backed up now and has a better recovery method</s>) I used balenaEtcher to format a spare USB I had and went into my BIOS to get started. Heres a fun fact about me no one really needed to know, but the only computer OS I've ever touched in my life has been Windows! I've never even seen a Mac in the metal.</p>
<hr>
<p>Installation went incredibly smooth and I was already having a blast sniffing around the system settings. I was calling Benjamin while first playing with it and I remarked how happy I was its default browser is Firefox! I was expecting it to have its own weird native web browser or using the terminal to install the one you wanted. I looked at some default applications it had like Rhythmbox, Hexchat, and Thunderbird. On my first install I uninstalled Hexchat, but couldn't get rid of Thunderbird for some reason with its dependencies.</p>
<p>I was having alot of fun my first night of using it but made my first grave error. For whatever reason, I thought it'd be a great idea to try and install Wine at the odd hour of 3 AM. I needed Wine in order to get my beloved Toontown Corporate Clash running (more on that later, turns out I didn't) I have no idea what button I pressed or even what error I really got but I knew for certain I fumbled the bag somewhere along the way. Maybe it was trying to install winetricks before running winecfg, maybe it was doing every command as sudo, the world may never know. I ended up doing a system restore the next day using Timeshift. That seemed to largely fix it although a few folders remained in my home directory. Not that it mattered much anyway for whats next.</p>



<h2 style="background-color: rgb(82, 107, 79); color: rgb(212, 211, 201); text-align: left;"><i>Swapping to XFCE and General Notes</i></h2>
<p>Some may recall a ancient blog post from a time long pass of when I wrote about using Windows Blinds from Stardocks to customize my systems. I later uninstalled it after someone I was friends with (Keyword, *was*) informed me Windows Updates broke it. But my quench for desktop customization never was fulfilled.. And this was one of my main reasons for even swapping to Linux anyways. I began researching about customizing, or "ricing" as I learned its called. But for some reason, whenever I'd apply a theme it would look a bit.. off. I was confused since the numerous videos I had been watching seemed to be for Cinnamon, and then I noticed that one little window was missing from my options. "Window style". It seems that recent updates to Cinnamon got rid of this option; further research on the topic appears to confirm this.</p>
<p>I was rather stuck on where to go next, I learned a bit more about what desktop enviorments do, and came to the conclusion I should probably swap to XFCE. I saw some things about being able to have *two* desktop enviorments, but also heard it was unstable and definetely not something for beginner plebs like myself. I reformatted my USB for XFCE (Really cool that it has a built in feature to verify the ISO for you instead of having to download another program!) and reinstalled. I was a bit worried that something would go awry with reinstalling drivers a second time and wiping the system <s>;admittedly I don't know much about how drivers work right now so this might be entirely unfounded</s> But all went well, and I have been using XFCE since then. It fits very comfortably for me. :]</p>
<hr>
<p>Anyways, enough talk about installing the OS. How does it work in practice, and what're the differences between Windows? Immediately, you have alot of control over your inner system. It was really cool sorting around the main files of my system (And of course I was very careful not to trip over anything) and seeing system processes. You're gonna be alot more involved using your computer, and having to remember some basic terminal commands is required; and some decent troubleshooting skills for programs. (<s>Totally salty here, but for example its not for the kinds of people who're on r/neocities asking how to center text</s>) The upside is theres alot of guides and tutorials online for downloading software and programs and also for any potential error you'd face. I'd recommend checking out the Linux Mint Forums for the latest discussions, if you're not using Mint theres a forum for literally every one under the sun. I briefly peeked into the Ubuntu forums sometimes, since Mint is based off of it.</p>
<p>I had prior experience using the Windows CMD prompt, so getting used to the terminal wasn't a challenge for me. Using the terminal really isn't all that scary as you'd think! Its really not some elite hacker thing, but I'd recommend making a txt on your desktop of quick to remember commands. Some things I wanted to do required it, like Panda3D and yt-dlp. (We'll talk more in-depth about those later) But their setup was incredibly easy. I'd recommend taking it slow and reading up tutorials and posts about the thing you're trying to use the terminal for, (Like installing something) and get ready to learn all about what dependencies it needs.</p>
<p>Updates are very easy to install too and not invasive or demanding. (<s>Or restart my fucking computer while I'm using it and re-enabling shit I turned off</s>) You should notice in the bottom right of your taskbar a little shield icon, this is the "Update Manager". You can also run "sudo apt update" in the terminal, but I use this more. My only warning is to <u>be careful about kernel updates!</u> I saw a kernel update a while ago and had a odd feeling about it, and looking it up on the Linux Mint Forums it seems that everyone was having issues with it. So keep an eye out for if it wants to up your kernel version (This is different from just security updates to the one you already have installed!) but if you turn on your computer to a black screen, look up how to boot into the grub menu. I had to do this once on another computer.</p>



<h2 style="background-color: rgb(82, 107, 79); color: rgb(212, 211, 201); text-align: left;"><i>Applications and Functions</i></h2>
<p>Lets talk about some of the default programs Mint came with, and how often I use them. One of my favorite system functions has to be Timeshift, the backup program. I'd recommend making quite a few backups while you first start installing things and setting up your system. My amount of snapshots I have scheduled to take are about 2 weekly and 2 daily. (Although I've seen some say thats over-kill) I'd recommend making one before you install a new program, before you do a system update, and to keep atleast one from the start of the month. Make sure to go back in there to delete older ones! Not only for system space, but for more accurate shots too.</p>
<p>Thunderbird is a mail client of sorts, made by darling to all dorks, Mozilla. I did not feel like fighting with Protonmail to get my e-mails working, it looked a bit convoluted with installing some other program. But I have been using it as a RSS reader! Finally I have one!! <s>Please make your site a RSS feed! I'm literally following myself since theres so little!</s></p>
<p><img src="/Main/Blog/Personal/Linux/Screenshot_2024-08-11_15-40-55.jpg" width="350" style="border: 4px groove rgb(82, 107, 79);"><br><a href="/Main/Blog/Personal/Linux/Screenshot_2024-08-11_15-40-55.jpg">Image</a></p>
<p>Theres also Rhythmbox, the mp3/audio media reader. I found out its also able to edit the metadata for audio files, which was very nice since I need it for my iPod. Theres also Libre Office, which is Linux's alternative to Microsoft Office from what I've heard. I piddled around in Writer for a bit when writing an application for something that required its format. Interesting little critter..</p>
<p>I still have not touched Hexchat, but from what I've gathered its some IRC program. I think interesting and I may return to it in the future, but I've heard its mostly occupied by basement specimens. Theres also some other programs like Celluloid and Hypnotix, although I have not touched those either, they seem to be for watching media and I believe one is even a TV feed! And to my shock, there seems to even be a torrent here called Transmission. Although I'm not in the mood to discover what Linux viruses look like.. xD</p>
<hr>
<p>To install programs, theres a few things you can do. For one, you can use the "Software Manager" which is like a giant repository for different applications. (Although be careful, sometimes programs listed here may be outdated/worse then just downloading directly from something like the official Github.) You can also run terminal commands, use appimages, or .deb files. The programs I wanted to install used all of these methods, but it's nothing to sweat about. When in doubt about what to do with an extension you don't recognize, please God, look up some answers first!</p>
<p>Now onto programs I installed and use regularly. Discord has always been a total resource hog, so I now use the web client. Discord has a few.. odd issues on Linux. I discovered this when I tried to watch Duck Dodgers with Benjamin, it can't stream audio?? I tried even downloading the software client from the software manager, to no avail. This is apparently a whole issue on Linux, and anything I looked up about it had mixed results pointing to negatives. I also noticed while using the software client was that it wouldn't tell me when I'd get a new message. The taskbar "(1)" didn't appear like when I used it on web client. Very cool Discord, very cool..</p>
<p>Next order of business was getting my favorite art program, FireAlpaca. I discovered that FireAlpaca has Linux support in the form of an appimage. I had one issue however, I could not get custom brushes to install from the shop. Anything I looked up heiled no results. FireAlpaca users are an endangered species as is, but a FireAlpaca-Linux user is probably a new breed of beetle. I decided to give Krita a try after hearing raving reviews about it. And I certainly see why! Its brush selection is impressive and I recall it having very unique functions. But then presented a new issue, was that I've been using FireAlpaca for almost a decade at this point. So getting used to an entirely new program, while not impossible, was incredibly disorienting. I recall having a literal headache as I tried to redo its layout to be similar to FireAlpaca.</p>
<p>Determined, I returned to FireAlpaca to get to the bottom of why the brushes weren't working. Whenever I'd click "install" on a brush, it would just do nothing. So I started watching some videos about how FireAlpaca brushes work, and how appimages work; and realized it being an appimage was the problem. What I believe was happening was that FireAlpaca had no place to store the brushes. Defeated again by no answers in search engines, I looked around the top bar settings and saw something like "open config folder" or something like that. Clicking it opened a folder for FireAlpaca! And then I was able to install brushes. Joyous day, joyous day!!!!</p>
<p>And then was just installing the driver for my Huion tablet. Which to my joy, had Linux support offered on its website. I recall I had some minor issue with it that I don't really remember now- But I believe I fixed it by going into the display settings and setting it so any other monitors (Since it's a screen tablet, my computer picked it up as being another monitor) all use the same screen. I haven't had any issues and I've been using this for a few months. So another item ticked off the list. :]</p>
<p>I got around to installing Blender, which I got from the official website using the stand-alone version. I needed it mostly for help previewing textures, since I make mods for Toontown; but I have used it to try out original modelling too. The only issue I've encountered is that for whatever reason, in 4.2 (Newest version I use) previewing the textures live causes my computer to lag and heat up. This doesn't happen when I use an older version like 2.79.</p>
<p>And to end off our software, something new I began using, Obsidian! I wanted a nice notes taking kind of application, my dear friend Pinkie swears up and down by Scrivener, but I don't have the money for a license. So I found Obsidian while searching for alternatives, and its whole "web" graph thingy really interested me. Like, look at this shit!</p>
<p><img src="/Main/Blog/Personal/Linux/Screenshot_2024-08-11_15-24-39.jpg" width="350" style="border: 4px groove rgb(82, 107, 79);"><br><a href="/Main/Blog/Personal/Linux/Screenshot_2024-08-11_15-24-39.jpg">Image</a></p>
<p>It can make checklists too! How fun!</p>
<hr>
<p>Now for some other functions that I use mainly in the terminal. Panda3D is a game engine of sorts, but I use it for extracting game files from Toontown for mods. Installing it took me a hot minute of research, I didn't want to screw up a engine install or timeshift back when I can avoid it. I opted for the Pip install method, and pleasantly my computer already came with Python3, so I just needed to install Pip.</p>
<p><img src="/Main/Blog/Personal/Linux/Screenshot_2024-08-11_15-57-14.jpg" width="350" style="border: 4px groove rgb(82, 107, 79);"><br><a href="/Main/Blog/Personal/Linux/Screenshot_2024-08-11_15-57-14.jpg">Image</a></p>
<p>Moving on was yt-dlp, which I had previously attempted to install but didn't feel like installing Python and Pip. (<s>Under the impression I didn't have Python already installed.. I know, funny</s>) Using wget for some reason is outdated and no longer works? But the installation was a success with Pip. I had a minor hiccup since I forgot to install ffmpeg, so don't forget to do that.</p>



<h2 style="background-color: rgb(82, 107, 79); color: rgb(212, 211, 201); text-align: left;"><i>Updating Locally and VSCode</i></h2>
<p>I've been meaning to swap away from the built-in Neocities code editor for a while. Not that I think its a bad editor, I think it does its job quite well; especially for beginners just starting. But increasingly have I found it to be rather clunky, and I also was concerned about backing up my site. (<s>In the way I mean of constantly having to keep it accurate</s>) And I just wanted to work on it offline. I used Notepad++ for a while when I was younger and first ever did HTML, and its not a bad editor at all! But I recall the research for pushing updates seeming confusing. One night while browsing idly I was incredibly intrigued by the tutorial made by <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20240228211434/https://webcatz.neocities.org/how-to/deploy-your-neocities-with-github">webcatz</a>.</p>
<p>There really aren't any differences between the VSCode editor vs the Neocities editor. I'd say its a thousand times better actually, and much quicker to navigate! I would highly recommend installing the "live server" plugin to see your changes. I've been using it since with only a few minor hiccups about "failed authentication" when pushing, which seemed to of just.. fixed themselves? I have no idea really, but it works.</p>



<h2 style="background-color: rgb(82, 107, 79); color: rgb(212, 211, 201); text-align: left;"><i>Gaming</i></h2>
<p>Apparently, gaming on Linux seems to be a bit of a inner-community meme for how convoluted it can be. I wasn't very nervous about getting games to run since I primarily game using Steam (Which has its own emulator called "Proton", and a website <a href="https://www.protondb.com/">seen here</a> for reviews on games running with it!) or some more well known games like Minecraft. Apologies this section isn't very in-depth, I just don't have much to say apart from it being pretty straight forward. I can't say I'm a good source on the most accurate "gaming on Linux" experience, since I'm doing this on a laptop. And in my experience of using laptops for a large chunk of my lifespan, laptops are always gonna be a bit under powered in terms of gaming. So I don't even attempt to run bigger games like "Dead by Daylight" or even "Project Diva Megamix"; as those wouldn't work very well even when I was on Windows.</p>
<p>I found it was able to run Minecraft very well, I use the Prism Launcher for mods! I also was able to run the following smoothly: Postal, Postal Redux, Postal 2, Stardew Valley, Papa's Freezeria, and The Stanley Parable: Ultra Deluxe. Papa's Freezeria was the only one without native Linux support and ran using Proton.</p>
<p>Also, tip in general no matter your operating system, but close Steam if you aren't using it. Good grief does Gaben like my computer resources.</p>



<h2 style="background-color: rgb(82, 107, 79); color: rgb(212, 211, 201); text-align: left;"><i>Toontown</i></h2>
<p>And now.. such an important thing it deserves its own section.. Toontown! If you're new here, I am a crazed lunatic about the defunct Disney MMO "Toontown Online". Particularly, I play the fan server Corporate Clash. This was my big break when I was deciding about swapping to Linux. And after the aforementioned Wine Incident and much research, I finally got it to run.</p>
<p>Interestingly, Corporate Clash seems to be the odd man out in terms of Toontown servers having Linux support. Rewritten, Tooniversal, Dessert Storm, and even Realms (Which is like a niche within a niche) all have Linux support to some capacity. To my knowledge, I believe all of these games are running off of the same source code and use the same engine (Being Panda3D) so I'm curious about the long wait.. Nonetheless,</p>
<p>Obviously I first did research, and was mostly lead to Reddit posts being 2-3 years old. This was not very promising as Corporate Clash is always updating, and I saw a few claims that their launcher would bust with the updates. So any old tutorials were likely not viable.. I already attempted Wine while I was using Cinnamon, although, granted, I did break that one-... I also attempted Bottles before installing Wine to no avail. But then I found it, the saving grace: Lutris.</p>
<p>The water was running a bit dry as I looked for definitive help on the topic. I even looked in the official Corporate Clash server. There was a user there who even had "The Linux Fan" in their nickname, but apparently had been told off for being too much tech support for helping with Linux. (Which again, totally salty here, but get on your damn port then or don't complain!) Crawling thru search engines, I stumbled upon a page for Corporate Clash, being reviewed on a website for the program Lutris. I was immediately interested since this seemed like the most up-to-date source for Corporate Clash running on Linux. And I realized the secret sauce of search terms I was missing. Shockingly, looking up for running it on Steam deck lead me to hopeful answers! I'll be honest, I know next to nothing about the Steam deck <s>Its too bougie for me</s> I had no idea it ran on Linux until now.</p>
<p>A few videos looking on how Lutris worked later, I anxiously downloaded Corporate Clash. I decided to select Tunetown as the launcher instead of the normal one, since I've heard problems with that working. This might just be for the Steam deck, but I really don't feel like figuring out how to uninstall in case it goofs up. I also did some quick research about unofficial launchers, and learned Tunetown is fine since its under "multi-toon controllers". (Which for you non-knowing readers, "multi-toon" refers to someone controlling multiple characters at once.) Then came entering my account. I decided to use one of my alts, Penny Gangadiddle, as the sacrifise to see what would happen.</p>
<p><img src="/Main/Blog/Personal/Linux/launcher.jpg" width="350" style="border: 4px groove rgb(82, 107, 79);"><br><a href="/Main/Blog/Personal/Linux/launcher.jpg">Image</a></p>
<p><img src="/Main/Blog/Personal/Linux/pennysuccess.jpg" width="350" style="border: 4px groove rgb(82, 107, 79);"><br><a href="/Main/Blog/Personal/Linux/pennysuccess.jpg">Image</a></p>
<p>And it worked!! I was pacing around my room like an expecting father as I waited for this to load. My utter shock and gasp upon seeing it, this was the height of my Linux career.</p>
<p>Since playing for a few months, there really aren't many issues apart from occasional freezing (Usually in-between game transitions, like when a new Cog battle phase starts) Just keep the graphics settings low, and also I don't play most games with another window open (Like Firefox) anyways.</p>



<h2 style="background-color: rgb(82, 107, 79); color: rgb(212, 211, 201); text-align: left;"><i>Ricing/Customization</i></h2>
<p>And finally, as mentioned earlier, I was very excited about the aspect of desktop customization. After the failed attempt with Cinnamon and a fresh install with XFCE, I was eager to try again. The two places I frequented for inspiration and links were <a href="https://www.gnome-look.org/browse/">gnome-look</a> and the <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/unixporn/">r/unixporn subreddit</a>. (Very great name I had to say to my mother) Pleasantly, many people on the subreddit link to the themes they use in the comments! Some even upload theirs to Github.</p>
<p>The idea for the theme I had in mind was being after the Bossbots from Toontown Online; and a mixture of the cogs.ink ARG website from Corporate Clash. I looked at Chicago95, but decided against it since it seemed a little out of my skill level and I didn't just want another 95 reskin. Although I was very tempted at the feature it has with being able to use real old Windows 95 themes! How cool!</p>
<p>After some browsing and gathering links to make a psuedo-moodboard, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/unixporn/comments/1apac1u/xfce_gnome_2_and_cde_inspired/">this post in particular</a> piqued my interest. Whose OP kindly included a <a href="https://github.com/mjdxp/desktop-theme">Github link</a> with their theme. Seeing the internals, I realized that seemingly most Linux themes are made up of image files and CSS. (Which I'm sure you can gather, I'm familiar with.) Heres a quick mockup I did of this theme before I went thru with recoloring.</p>
<p><img src="/Main/Blog/Personal/Linux/desktopmockup.jpg" width="350" style="border: 4px groove rgb(82, 107, 79);"><br><a href="/Main/Blog/Personal/Linux/desktopmockup.jpg">Image</a></p>
<p><img src="/Main/Blog/Personal/Linux/firstdesk.jpg" width="350" style="border: 4px groove rgb(82, 107, 79);"><br><a href="/Main/Blog/Personal/Linux/firstdesk.jpg">Image</a></p>
<p>And heres how it looked when freshly installed. Quite nice! But still lots of work to do for it to get where I want. There really wasn't anything special going on with editing the theme, just cracking it open and some tedious editing in FireAlpaca. Onwards, I edited this photo from a old newsletter as the background! The start menu button is also from the old Toontown website, where they offered some icon packs. For other icons, I returned to Chicago95 to steal its application ones. And to top it all off, I did edit my terminal theme lightly to be various colors. I debated on editing the ASCII art shown when using neofetch, but didn't feel like it.</p>
<p><img src="/Main/Blog/Personal/Linux/backgroundcogs.png" width="350" style="border: 4px groove rgb(82, 107, 79);"><br><a href="/Main/Blog/Personal/Linux/backgroundcogs.png">Image</a></p>
<p>Before we get to the final look, lets take a quick detour for Firefox themes. While I was fine with most programs being a little inconsistent with the main theme, Firefox stuck out like a sore thumb and was really bothering me. Unfortunately, at the time of writing this I did all of this a few months ago. So my exact memory is a bit fuzzy, but! I do have links saved for what I used to help me. Being mainly <a href="https://youtu.be/bw_M7q3Mtag?si=aFi39sbczT6PEdsS">this video</a>, for getting started with opening up Firefox.</p>
<p>Also found from the subreddit, was <a href="https://github.com/Rifqi2007c/firefox-css">this users Firefox CSS</a> I used as a base for editing the index page. And I edited <a href="https://github.com/osem598/Firefox-98">this themes</a> colors, which I found from <a href="https://trickypr.github.io/FirefoxCSS-Store.github.io/">this repository</a> of Firefox CSS themes.</p>
<p><img src="https://files.catbox.moe/kn6tak.png" width="350" style="border: 4px groove rgb(82, 107, 79);"><br><a href="https://files.catbox.moe/kn6tak.png">Image</a></p>

<p>And here is the final look! I've been using this theme since I made it, and I'm very pleased with it being my first attempt at ricing. Below here are some WIP shots, like when I tried out a top bar, and a old theme I had for Firefox.</p>

<h2 style="background-color: rgb(82, 107, 79); color: rgb(212, 211, 201); text-align: left;"><i>Should you get into Linux?</i></h2>
<p>My months long journey into using Linux has been a ride I've greatly enjoyed, its really made using computers feel fun again. The possibilites and amount of distros out there to tinker with really make it a never ending rabbithole of things to do. My only regret has really been not swapping sooner. ..But with that said, even as a pretensious nerd, and a new found member of the Linux cult, I have to say I don't think Linux is for everyone.</p>
<p>The bitter truth is not every person is tech savvy or has the time to be swapping their entire computer. Learning about which distro to use, finding a USB to flash, and then figuring out how to configure all their previous programs. And some people just don't simply have that computer brain in them to navigate it even with a tutorial. And trust me, I love making fun of normies and dense netizens as much as the next Arch user. But I don't think its entirely their fault the way computers, and the internet as a whole, is the way it is. This is a much more larger rant for another day in another blog entry, but my tldr is we should be more angry at these bigger companies like Microsoft for holding a monopoly on the computer market.</p>
<p>I don't know the answers to these big questions, so I can only speculate on what I've seen and heard. I don't think Linux is a miracle pill for all the issues in the computer world, (Like for example, its "immunity to viruses" is a flat out myth, and just that people don't make as many for them since no one really expects them.) but I think the main issue is a lack of options. I think many internet users today are uninformed about many things like their privacy and how their computer even really works. Look at the massive uptick of ransomware attacks within the past few years.</p>
<p>And my dark confession is that I still do occasionally use Windows, being my Windows 10 tower PC for larger games or just ones that don't have any way to run. And there we have another reason I just demonstrated myself, that theres just some things Linux can't run. Its a bit of a vicious cycle with "game doesn't have Linux support > no one feels encouraged to swap to Linux > game doesn't bother making support since no one uses Linux". But you might say, "But Beau, if theres a bunch of operating systems in the world, so many games would take eons optimizing for them!" I'm very aware, as you just saw me use this hypothetical person for, my point is things like this can't continue. And we atleast need choices.</p>
<p>With that said, I hate the doomerism of a "computer apocalypse" with Bill Gates getting laser eyes and sacrifising his employees. My hope is that people will protest these things more and for me, my personal freedom in a way, was swapping. So take that with what you will.</p>

<p>My mom has this Windows 10 laptop thats a absolute slug fest. Probably from her having both Chrome and Firefox installed and never listening to me about browsers- but thats besides the point. This thing is a beaut, with a rainbow keyboard and quite nice ridges, it'd be a shame to just let it rot. She doesn't want it anymore anyways, so with USB in hand, lets test how true it is that Linux can revive old systems!</p>

<p>Funnily, the longest part of this whole process was just trying to get into the BIOS. Whenever I'd restart the poor thing it'd do a Windows update that'd take 30 years to go thru. But once I found the BIOS screen, damn this thing is fancy, Its even animated!</p>

<p>With bated breath I waited as it took a good second to boot into grub, and to happiness, it was able to get into the live session! Not much else fancy happening here apart from standard installation. After installing the Nvidia drivers and moving onto the normal updates, we ran into our first issue.. You may recall earlier me mentioning kernel updates. And I was wary to look at the update list, to make sure it wouldn't try installing the kernel that it wanted to on my main laptop. But I saw it wanted to install the version I was using there, so I assumed it'd be fine. And then, it happened,</p>

<p>A black screen! I didn't think anything about it at first, I thought it was just thinking *reallyyyy* hard with processing the updates. But after 15 minutes I figured something went wrong. I was pretty tired at this point in the day, so I left her to sit <s>for a few days until I felt like it</s> overnight. I researched this issue, and was able to fix it by booting into grub and selecting the older kernel version. Crisis averted!</p>
<p>Since then, shes been a smooth sailor. Admittedly, after finishing all of this, I don't have much experience using this laptop. Its not mine, and I don't have any reason to really use it besides being a backup. I worry a bit about its drive life- but for now, hooray! Another RGB laptop lifespan extended.</p>
