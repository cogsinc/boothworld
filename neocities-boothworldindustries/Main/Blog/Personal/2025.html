<h3><b><i><u>Mar 6th</u></i></b></h3>
<p>I've had a very busy past month or so- I don't even really know where to start. So I guess I'll start by mentioning my birthday earlier in February on the 6th. 19 ! I don't know how to feel about it really. I say this every year when my birthday comes up. I usually hate it because of how other people make it. But for once I had a very pleasant birthday. I got Aqua Teen Hunger Force on DVD, I got a chocolate cake, I got waffle house, it was a nice cool sunny day.</p>
<p>Last night I was thinking more about my age again. I get ahead of myself when it comes to it I guess. I thought, "Oh God next year I'll be 20, then I'll be 21, then I'll be legally able to drink ! God, I hope I'm able to drive by then, I hope I have a job by then, hope I'm not such a dork, next thing you know I'll be 50 and dead !" Then I started thinking about death. I done gave myself a anxiety attack about it, really great since I hadn't ate or slept in hours. But I calmed down after I got some yogurt in my system (Wisdom teeth troubles). I still think about it though, in random moments I get that burst of phobia that makes me feel imaginary. I don't feel it right now though, so I don't really have much to say.</p>
<p>I don't really remember much of what happened in February until the end of it when I got my teeth removed. It was a very fun month though, the TF2 SDK got released ! God I need to get on that. I say that all the time. Anyways, my favourite character in DBD got 2 outfits. One is Valentines day oriented !!! Thats my fucking holiday !!! I also got my hands on a psychical copy of Postal 2. It costed me a pretty penny but was totally worth it.</p>
<p>So the main event has been my wisdom teeth. I got them out about almost 3 weeks ago at this point. Dare I say, it wasn't really *that* painful ? It was mostly just swelling, and the horrible hunger I had for a week since I could only really eat liquids/super soft food. A few days ago I finally got to the irrigation stage (Or the point where I felt comfortable using it, without fear of knocking out the blood clot) and I'm so happy I can eat solids again. I had meatloaf and potatoes tonight !! Thank God !! Anyways, two nights ago I was cleaning and I thought to myself "Huh, why can't I really see or even feel the socket on this side of my mouth ? I can see the other one really clearly" so I had my dad look to see if it was just in a blind spot. It turns out that side somehow already closed ?? So I've been more daring eating solid foods, just sticking to that side.</p>
<p>Protein smoothies (mainly blueberry or mango) and tomato soup (with crackers) have been life savers for me. I had some tomato soup this morning actually, thankfully I really like it as is. Especially with crackers soaked in it ! It's a bit foreign getting used to eating again, but I get better everytime I wake up so. Speaking of, I slept thru most of today. I've been really fatigued lately, which I assume is from the healing and not being able to eat full solid meals for a while. It sucks because I feel really mentally motivated, I'm looking thru my site and to-do list right now just itching to start working and writing again. But I know I'll get tired very quickly and need to let myself rest. I cleaned my whole room yesterday, so that's probably not helping my tiredness-... </p>
<p>I felt a very terrible wave of depression over the past 2 weeks. Which likely is just the aforementioned healing effects and other personal things. I contemplated about the site for a bit. The thing about depression is sometimes I can't fully tell what I really desire, versus what my depression wants of me. Often in my worse states, when I go to reread what I thought, I completely forgot what I was like. But I contemplated about writing blog entries, I often get this terrible self image and paranoia thing. I don't know how to describe it fully, sometimes I want myself to get worse because it feels freeing in a sense. I have this overwhelming urge to rip off my skin to its muscle for as long as I can remember.</p>
<p>I might make myself some matcha tea later, something nice and healthy to drink since I didn't have a smoothie today. I might also try some softer cereal. But does anyone else feel wrong having a drink with cereal, besides water ? I dunno, I always considered cereal half beverage half food. So it feels like too much liquid ! Oh well, I'll probably have them together so by the time I finish my cereal the tea will have cooled off.</p>
<p>To keep myself busy, I've been playing alot of my Steam Deck and achievement hunting. Primarily in Papa's Pizzeria. I just finished Postal 2 ! Took almost.. a year.. shivers.. But because of that I've had alot of writing brewing I hope to get to soon. I also want to re-rice my laptop, something dark aero themed I think. I dunno what I'll theme my main desktop... Maybe something XP themed ? I'll think about it more after I redo my laptop. I've really been getting into Genitorturers, specifically their song "120 Days" I've had on loop for a while. And of course Tokyo Rose's "Goodbye Almond Eyes" and "Spectacle".</p>

<h3><b><i><u>Jan 26th</u></i></b></h3>
<p>Hello !! Goodness, I wanted to get this out by the end of January, but I've been so busy this update will likely be pushed towards the start of February. I know nobody is, like, depending on me updating my website or something. But I try to set deadlines for myself and it appears I bit off more then I could chew in terms of getting it out on time-..</p>
<p>Anyways, happy new year !! I've been having a wonderful and eventful new year already. I feel very hopeful and happy for once. Which is so odd to say, I didn't think a older-me would be saying that. Because there's been so much going on I decided to just break it up into bulletin points and chapters of sorts. I figure it'd be easier for me to write and also to read.</p>

<p>---<br>
Life Updates:<br>
---<br>
My legal name change is mostly done ! This has been a massive weight off of my chest. Most of my major documents have been updated, I am currently fighting with my primitive birth state laws about updating my birth certificate. But for the large part, I can live life as normal for now. I also technically have a job of sorts for now ? Which is just working for a family member. I don't really view it as a job, it doesn't feel like I'm really doing anything ? But I've been told it's majorly helpful, and it gives me a nice allowance. Which is very nice for now, until I learn to begin driving. Speaking of which, I don't know how learning to drive will go. I absolutely hate cars, they're just giant death machines made out of metal. Nothing good about them. When I was younger I'd try to pretend I was driving, but I'd space out and forget I was meant to be pretend-driving. I can barely feel my own body spacial awareness as is, I hate the idea of managing a giant disgusting thing. Not to mention my heavy distrust of other drivers, I live in such a blissfully unaware state full of senile old people or someones uncle with anger management issues. Ugh. Anyways, car rant aside, I'll have to learn it eventually.</p>
<p>I almost went to jury duty ! I got a letter in the mail towards the end of last year. Despite what you may think, I was actually pretty excited about going. I figured it'd be like a adult field day or something. Which is exciting considering I didn't really ever go to school nor do I leave my house more then thrice a month-.. And just a excuse to dress-up nicely. Why do people stare when you wear something nicer then pants and a shirt ? When I went to court for my name change, the only other person dressed-up as nicely was some lawyer. Anyways, I was told to call back a certain date. And I did ... for 3 days straight ! They kept telling us to call back again tomorrow, until eventually we were dismissed. I guess I was relieved, but I was pretty mad on behalf of people who had to keep rescheduling. Can you imagine if I took care of someone, or just had big responsibilites ? My dad (the only one who could drive me) had to take off a few days for this bullshit. Which wasn't terrible, thank God we have disability. But Jesus Christ ! And my state has issues with people not coming for jury duty, I found out a mayor or a neighboring county even made a public statement about arresting people if they don't show up. No wonder why they don't ! What a joke. Atleast I got bragging rights among my similarly aged friends who haven't been summoned yet.</p>
<p>I've finally started to feel less burnt out about art. I overdid it in July with ArtFight, as I tend to do almost every year. This year I will likely limit myself to a small amount of attacks, or only go for people I am friends or acquainted with. Some people don't even reply under pieces I've made for them, which feels really sour. I hope the spirit is stronger this year. This creates another problem, that I just feel unsatisfied with my art constantly. Not original enough, not bold enough, not "cool" enough, not mature-looking enough. I've tried to think about this problem for a while, I've spent alot of time privately doodling studies of bodies and shading. I linger towards the thought that this is just a issue with how I view myself in a way. My art is a extension of myself, it is me in a way. (Yes, I am pretensious like that, sorry) So how I feel I am viewed is tied to it. Too childish, unreasonable, girly, things like that. Thankfully my solution isn't to just draw pornography (No shade to anyone who does, though ! I love whores !) but I guess I've been taking time to self reflect. Which leads to my next paragraph,</p>
<p>Part of the reason for the long delay in updates is just that I needed some time to think. About things I want to do this year, but also how I carry myself. I've been mass archiving some old accounts of mine, tracking down ones I forgot existed, updating my password book. Basically, I want to be more mindful in the future. Of things I do, and look at, we live in a era of what people call "digital slop". Ragebait, consumerism, things like that. I'm not gonna sit here and pretend I'm some digital messiah of thoughts or something like that. Although, I am a paranoid loser about the government spying on me. Or whoever I convince myself "they" is when I'm not at my best. But thats besides the point, I'm trying to say that I want to stop and smell the roses. I realized I've distracted myself for so long by other people, and not in a good way. I feel almost disappointed in myself that, in a way, I started to view other artists as a "constant output". I guess I became a part of the problem, mentally. I had pitted myself against other people, comparing myself to them. Why can't I post as much, why don't I have as many friends, why am I not as cool, stupid stuff like that. So I hope now that I'm cleaning my digital mess up, I can focus more on my own work.</p>
<p>On a similar note, on mass archiving, I plan on writing a blog entry sometime in the future about downloading media. I have a old draft about my iPod and Sony Diskman somewhere, but I plan on refining it to be a series about how to back-up media. Things disappear, art, videos, audio, games, culture. It's important to save it all. I view my USB like a time capsule almost. I just need to.. word it in a way that doesn't make the FBI knock on my door. Haha.. (< sweating) I recently purchase some writeable DVDs, whenever I figure them out I'd love to make a entry about styling DVD menus ! And also printing out things like CD covers or how to start a psychical media collection.</p>
<p>So, a new topic entirely, but my wisdom teeth are coming in. I have a consultation on the 4th of February to see when they can get them removed. They lay just barely under my gums, so I've been told this is the exact time to get them out; since they haven't impacted yet. Obviously I'm a bit nervous, it's a minor surgery and my father and sister have already had theirs removed with no diffculty. And I take after them alot medically, so I'm sure it'll be fine. I had been put under sometime in 2023 for fixing cavities towards the back of my mouth (I have a unnaturally small mouth and it can't be reached without gagging me) and I'm glad I did, since I know what to expect with anathesia. Thankfully also I didn't say anything embarassing or revealing while I was waking up- so hopefully I won't be more loopy when coming out. Or atleast I'll have my mouth stuffed with guaze-.. I hope they let me keep them !! I was talking to my hygenist a few days ago and we were all talking about it, and she said she'd never heard someone keeping their wisdoms. So I'll have to ask the surgeon if that's something they'll let me do. I really really hope they do !! I grew those damn it !!! I don't care if they're broken up either. I just want my bones !! I want to figure out some out-there art project involving them too. The more I weird my mother out the better.</p>
<p>Sometime in spring my parents are going to be replacing our flooring with lovely carpet. I'm very excited, I've loathed the floorboards they put in even when I was barely 10 years old. I want nice dark brown carpet.. and baby blue walls ! I can't stand this aslyum off-white my mother insists on painting everything. She hated when I wanted my old room painted dark blue, she still gets snarky about it. Anyways, I started boxxing up my room a bit. Since I have quite alot of things, so figured I'd do it now so my mom has less to deal with. Speaking of- why do middle aged people just act like everything is the end of the world ? I don't know how to describe it, but, like, chores. My father is dreadful with them so we barely bother asking anymore. He overloads the laundry and the washer psychically shook out of the wall. Or he overloads the dishwasher and nothing gets washed. How were you in the military for so long if you can't follow simple instructions ?! And then my mom acts like feeding the cats is a nightmare. I just don't get it, I loved doing the chores while they were gone. Pray my marriage isn't as hair pulling as theirs is to witness. I'm not excited about getting carpet since my mother is a bit lazy with cleaning up the cats throwing up, she bought a handheld carpet cleaner but just refuses to use it. I'm moving on from this rant now, my head is starting to psychically hurt just thinking about it.</p>

<p>---<br>
Year-To-Do<br>
---<br>
I want to learn to sew ! Or do some sort of psychical craft like clay making. My ultimate magnum-opus this year will be to make a clay doll of one of a few characters I have in mind. This is all assuming my mom gets her office together in a timely manner for me to start. But I hope to atleast make progress this year towards learning one of these. Alternatively, I could also learn crochet. I've done cross stitching before :]</p>
<p>Learn to drive so I can get a job. My mom is fine with me driving her car. The main issue really is they both think my dad will teach me, which I really don't want because it's his weird fulfillment fantasy fetish (< THE FETISH PART IS A JOKE) and he's a total tyrant when driving. He's such a condescending prick I'd rather deal with some old fart I'm not related to. Or God, just my mother sitting with me instead. His presence makes me shrivel up. But anyways, theres some decent jobs near me that don't require the highway I think. I'll do anything but food service.. shiver.</p>
<p>Depending on how well driving and job searching went, it'd be nice to work towards hormone replacement therapy or some sort of work revolving around that. That also depends on how.. my country's legislation wants to be. But I think it'll still be worth working towards. My desire is to start it before I turn 23.</p>
<p>I might fly for the first time this year ! Depending on what my sister is doing, I can go visit her. Which means I can also go see Benjamin.. It'd be lovely to see him sometime this year.</p>
<p>I've been trying to learn ASL, and I know a few basic signs. I think my main struggle will just be with signing fast. ;; I think it's important to know atleast one other language.</p>
<p>I want to finish atleast 10 OC reference sheets and biographies this year. And also my lengthy list of "art/website to do" I have written down that I refuse to show Less-Someone-Steals-My-Ideas-Again. I've been sitting on some ideas for almost 3 years now, which is simply absurd. I've considered making a public "to do" list, maybe it would motivate me more or something.</p>

<p>---<br>
Personal Thoughts<br>
---<br>
I feel alot better this year. And thats not just the seasonal depression clearing up talking, I think I really mean it this time. I'm still unsure what to think of things, myself and the world. Some days I feel calm, like if a truck were to fall onto me and I died, I'd just accept it. Other days I think about making a bunker and using cash only. I feel myself simultaneously getting better and worse. I know something is wrong with me, even if I don't fully know what. I write paragraphs for blogs and go to reread them and find several unrelated tangents in them. Or things that don't really make sense, but did in the moment. I know the way I view others and myself isn't normal, but I guess somewhat grounded in reality. Have you noticed how cruel people have gotten ? Some people are saying theres a big moral decay. My parents say how everything was better in the 90s. But I'm not naive like that, it's just that they were young and lucky to not be brown or in a war torn country, so of course things were "better" in the 90s. I realize that reading alot tends to hurt me, I have too many things to consider all of which are just out of my control. When I try to vent my woes to my mother, shes rather thought dismissing in a way. The solution to these problems isn't just "well, it doesn't bother me, so who cares !". She did say something to me though that made me feel a bit better, was that all I can donate is my time. I like to think I have alot of time left in the world. The main thing that makes me feel reassured is seeing old people. Seeing them doing their craft, or their careers, or art, it makes me feel like I still have time to be alive. What is life and what you make of it, I guess is just a question people have been asking ourselves since we first became sentient. I don't know what to, I know what I want to do though. It's weird, simultaneously I want to be some respectable artist, but I despise the idea of having a following. Maybe my issue is that I'm too concsious of other people.</p>
<p>My overall emotion for the past few years has been guilt, in a sense. Guilt for feeling happy, guilt for being alive, I keep thinking "it should be someone else, not me here". And I feel like I'm wasting whoever-should've-been-me's time, doing nothing. I feel like every other day my brain spirals into these ideas, like a never ending rabbithole. I wish I had a solution, I wish I wasn't just on the edge of being batshit, I wish I was just fully into it, I wish I wasn't so lucid or aware. Sure I live in a level of delusion, we all do. The feeling I lose control over is anger, I think. I don't know how to describe it, but certain things make me twitch. Or start speaking without me doing it. I don't know how to describe that feeling, but I guess its the largest loss of control I have over myself.</p>
<p>Peoples solutions to these problems are always thought dismissing too. Its the same reason why I rarely tell people I never went to school really, or just remain stuck in bed. They don't like to think about it, because there is no solution besides to wait. I wait slowly for the day I learn to drive, wait slowly for the day I open a bank account, wait slowly for the day I can fly away. And I pray to God I don't wait for so long I'm 30 and still live here. It's unsightly, we don't like unsightly. I don't want someone to save me, I just wish the world was kinder. And as always I have unreasonable demands. At this point I have to laugh at myself, before someone else does. Aren't I so melodramatic.</p>
<p>It's strange to think of myself as a young adult, technically. In two years from now I'll be of legal drinking age. What a horrorifying thought. Not because I'm afraid of being old, ugly, and dying. But just that I know nothing will change. So I'll say it out loud, so God, being the comedian he is, will prove me wrong. I feel like I've still barely begun to live my teenage years. My mother told me the other day "HoW pRoUd" she is that she noticed I'm "maturing". I told her in a joking tone something like "yes, I'm more capable of things then you think", and she became offended. I think about that interaction often, because somehow I feel like my relationship to my parents has gotten both better and worse, too. They've become kinder over the years, but something always lays under the surface of me. It confuses me, my identity feels so tied to them in a way I can't stand. Being a "mini" version of your parents, one or the other, bleeds into everything you do. It feels hard to be a individual, everything feels like their face stares at you. I wish my parents were more loose with me then my sister. A part of me has a deep anger, why didn't you help me. Why can't you realize what you've done. Why did you ruin me. But I have to let go of that anger. In a way, it feels like I'm forgiving them without them realizing anything was ever wrong. Because I can't tell them anything was ever wrong, thats a worse argument.</p>
<p>Small victories in everyday. Today I finished some work for my job, I had watermelon chunks, my cat waited outside my bedroom door as I woke up to greet me, I'm closer to 100%ing another game, someone I was playing against the other day in Dead by Daylight was really silly and noticed I had the "Deathslingers please mori me" in my Steam profile; and we had a kind interaction after the game ended. Even if they are trivial, it makes life better. These are reminders that good can still exist somewhere, and it would be selfish to ignore them. I'm not sad or upset really, despite all I've said the past few paragraphs. They are just thoughts. Tomorrow is another day and as long as I am still alive I have the capacity to do better and change. Even if I feel the things I do daily are worthless, as long as I have hope and can notice the little things, then I'm not doomed. I long for the day I sit on my own porch and get bitten by a mosqito. The day I take in another cat. The day a movie I really like comes out. The day I get my favorite meal. There will always be a next time, even if not in this life. But it's important I make the most of this one.</p>
