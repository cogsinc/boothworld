<h3><i>On October 13st 2022 was Splatnet, a Splatoon themed webring, created.</i></h3>

<p><img src="https://files.catbox.moe/pgye69.gif" width="200"><br><u>Written: October 13st 2023</u></p>
<p>Its been a year?! Can you believe that! It feels like both forever ago and just yesterday. I wanted to do a special blog entry detailing some behind the scenes stuff, along with a grand announcement :]...</p>

<p>I made Splatnet on a whim and hyperfixation. I was starting to become pretty intermediate with code at the time, I wanted to try something daring with creating a webring. This was also around the time of Splatoon 3s release, so interest was piqued with many of my mutuals and friends about there being a Splatoon ring.</p>

<p>I was really shocked at the amount of people wanting to join Splatnet..!! I still get messages from time to time asking about it. (Apparently it was mentioned on Melonforums!? :O) Whenever I'd get a new e-mail, I remember pacing around my room for a minute in awe and wonder at how people thought it was worthy to join.</p>

<p>It really means the world to me in words I can't express. Which is why I hope the following can convey my gratitude for the patience and continued support of Splatnets members..</p>

<hr style="border: 0; border-top: 2px solid blue;">
<p>Splatnet has recieved a major update! A complete makeover along with optimization and better code management. Primarily, members can now create their own custom styles for their widget!</p>

<p>Lets get into what brought on this update, along with what this means for members moving on in the future..</p>

<p>First being, as I mentioned earlier, I was starting to get more into code when I created Splatnet. So the code for it on the back end... Was very messy. There was a individual CSS file for EVERY style, for example. Which for you non code monkeys, means it took up alot of space and wasn't very pretty!</p>

<p>I slowly became a bit overwhelmed with the amount of attention Splatnet recieved. I wasn't very satisified with it as time went on.. There was even a point I considered handing it off to someone else. </p>

<p>"So what made you decide to redo it/keep going?" In large part it was from the kind things people said about it. Someone in particular, when I applied to their webring, they said how they wanted to join Splatnet when it reopened. It really made me a bit teary eyed.. But also I just.. ...Randomly! :] I kind of just sat down one day and thought "I need to get started on updating this again" and so I did.</p>

<p>Now moving forward.. For members in the first iteration of the ring, you'll need to update your code! You've likely already been informed via a message left on your page or guestbook. So check the "style" section for more details!</p>

<p>For new members of the ring... ...Yay! :D You can join now.</p>

<p>In about a months time, the old code will be deleted for space. But don't worry, archives of them will exist in the museum.</p>

<p>Splatoon was my childhood game. I remember downloading the test fire for it on the WiiU in 2015. ..I also got the times wrong since I was about 8 and kind of a dingus. (I did eventually get to play) I sadly wasn't able to play Splatoon 2 during its peak due to the prices of Switches at the time. But I had so much fun playing Octo Expansion last year..!</p>

<p>I played some Splatoon 3 on its release, but I'll be honest.. This games really overwhelming! Its hard to feel casual about it. Nonetheless.. I'm really excited for Side Order and certainly will be playing on its release.</p>

<p>Making Splatnet was a really fun way to channel my love for Splatoon, even after all these years of it fading in and out of my mind. I'm happy those (Who are likely much more into it then I am lol) who enjoy the series can have a little hub for other fans.</p>

<p>Thanks for reading, stay fresh! -Beau </p>
