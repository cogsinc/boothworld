<mark style="background-color: rgb(88, 28, 0); color: rgb(255, 228, 108); mix-blend-mode: screen;"><img src="/Main/Blog/MediaLog/fwpoint1.gif" width="14"> <i>Genre</i><br>A linear story exploration-type game. You play as a fire watchman, and your job details walking around the forest to check on things. (Obviously, this begins to change as you have to play detective) You also chat with your boss over the walkie-talkie, open crates around the map, among other things. I quite like this genre of story telling, so no complaints about the pacing. I would kind of describe it like playing a movie! I will say that at times I found the movement a bit clunky. This might just be a issue with bad sense of direction on my half, but trying to figure out where I was going via the map and walking around at the same time was a bit annoying.. But I guess it added a sense of realism in navigation.<br><br>
<img src="/Main/Blog/MediaLog/fwpoint1.gif" width="14"> <i>Style</i><br>I don't know how to really word this style, I've seen it before, its almost kind of painted? Kind of faux-retro. I love how saturated and orange everything is. As someone whose lived near/in the woods for most of my life, it really captures the beauty. It kind of fulfilled my desire to run around in the wilderness.<br><br>
<img src="/Main/Blog/MediaLog/fwpoint1.gif" width="14"> <i>Story</i><br>
<img src="/Main/Blog/MediaLog/fwpoint2.gif" width="15"> I am a sucker for games I get to larp as someone with a cool job. So I really liked the watch tower and getting to run around to do tasks. I thought Henry was a nice protagonist, I liked his dialogue and I found him to be a realistic guy I didn't have trouble sympathizing with. Although I don't need to *like* characters in order to get into the story (Like Mitzi from The Cat Lady) I just.. could not stand Delilah. I really wanted to like her, and I was hoping she'd grow on me as time went on. But she's just so pushy and unserious, I think that kind of hindered my ability to get into things as much as I wanted to. While I found some of Henry's actions to be critqueable (Like him leaving behind his wife, although thats not a easy decision either way given her dementia.) Delilah just kept rubbing me the wrong way. And then the shady stuff shes implied to be doing/covering up, on top of flirting with a guy whose wife is ill! Ugh, maybe its just my sensitivity to voices, but I wish I liked her more.<br><br>
<img src="/Main/Blog/MediaLog/fwpoint2.gif" width="15"> Was not expecting how unnerving this game can be! I wouldn't go as far to describe it as horror, but the feeling of being followed around and watched really gets up on you. Especially after the first encounter with the figure with the flashlight towards the start, it really spooked me thinking like "Oh God, why don't they give us self defense gear??". <br><br>
<img src="/Main/Blog/MediaLog/fwpoint2.gif" width="15"> I found the overall mystery that leads up to Ned and Brian really interesting. I don't know what I was expecting really, but I liked where it was heading. In a way I think I was just relieved it wasn't something supernatural. Weird shit happens in the woods anyways without divine intervention. I like the way we don't see other people. Like Delilah, Ned, or the girls by the lake. Finding the remnants of what people left behind really adds to the "Oh God I'm all alone in this giant ass forest" unnerving factor. I feel like the way it lead up to finding Brian made it more impactful. When I found him, I knew it was gonna happen something along those lines by the frequency the Goodwins were being mentioned. It felt very natural, but still incredibly haunting. I like how things don't feel over the top with this game.<br><br>
</mark><img src="/Main/Blog/MediaLog/fwborder.png" width="455"><br>  
<mark style="background-color: rgb(88, 28, 0); color: rgb(255, 228, 108); mix-blend-mode: screen;">Theres alot to say about this game honestly, and I can see why it's been praised for so long. I really liked the background details, like the messages we find between the two guys in the crates. Although I dislike her, I still liked the interactions between Henry and Delilah. ..Before it was kind of implied Delilah has feelings for him or something. Which kind of soured it for me- If you can't tell, I'm not super emotionally attached. Thats not to say I found it to be a unpleasant experience, I really loved walking around and uncovering things as they happened. The free roam mode after completing the story I funnily kind of enjoyed more. I like taking photos damn it! Theres likely so many details and dialogue options I missed or haven't seen. So although I'm not the biggest fan, this is definitely a case of "I can see why others love it so much". I have high hopes for its developers. :]</mark>

<i>Susan Ashworth is a suicidal woman who takes the plunge into ending her life. What was meant to be a peaceful end to suffering, follows a odd series of events.</i><br>

<img src="/Main/Blog/MediaLog/clborder.png" width="455"><br>  
<img src="/Main/Blog/MediaLog/clpoint1.png" width="12"> <i>Genre</i><br>Point & click adventure story, which I really enjoyed! I'm typically a fan of "novel" games, I really liked the puzzle solving and minor exploration this included. I've seen some describe it as "horror". There are a few unnerving or creepy moments in the game, but nothing that'll keep you up all night. I would call it more "suspensful". I will say, that if you're not a fan of *alot* of yapping, this might not be for you. There are very long bits of dialogue you cannot skip over, or even pause during. In my opinion, it's not a snooze fest and I was very invested in the story. But you should probably play this when you're certain you won't be bothered. (And also while theres rain outside for maximum effect)<br><br>
<img src="/Main/Blog/MediaLog/clpoint1.png" width="12"> <i>Style</i><br>Despite it's gloomy and monochrome look, it never bored with visuals at all. It has a sort of "scrapbook" like style at certain points, with realistic sort of looking bits. The few moments the game shows color really impact, and stand out beautifully. A moment that comes to mind is young Susan with her red dress, or Liz's outfit. The soundtrack is just as gorgeous too, and really adds to the ambient of the visuals. For a game made in 2012, it has aged like wine.<br><br>
<img src="/Main/Blog/MediaLog/clpoint1.png" width="12"> <i>Story</i><br>
<img src="/Main/Blog/MediaLog/clpoint2.gif" width="15"> The first major plot point we're introduced to (Besides Susan killing herself) is the "parasites", by The Queen of Maggots. The Queen (as she will be shortened to) is a looming figure thru out the story. As we always return to her cottage to blow out another one of her candles, and also her odd interaction with Mitzi. (Which really isn't explained or referenced later? Why she gives her a kiss on the cheek. Maybe I'm just dense and this was some sort of foreshadowing to Mitzi's illness.) She tells us about "the parasites", and how they will come to kill us. And for some reason, she is giving us the power of her candles to constantly revive ourselves. I always wondered what The Queen's true motives were with Susan, or why she wanted Susan so badly to kill the parasites and survive. The Queen is later revealed to be some sort of personification of Susan's depression ("The illness thats been with me all along..") which I really liked. But I still think she is something more, since she is the one who has this great knowledge and abilities. I think she's a great antagonistic character. She obviously has great power, but is just easily sort of defeated by Susan going "I'm not doing that lol". My theory is she lives off of peoples despair? And shes only as powerful as someone lets her be.<br><br>
<img src="/Main/Blog/MediaLog/clpoint2.gif" width="15"> Speaking of the parasites, when they are first introduced I was lead to believe they'd be a pretty large part of the story (Which they kind of are) and I was expecting some sort of mystery bit. Where you have to choose who you speak to carefully, as The Queen says they want to decieve us. The parasites are "guy who really wants to kill us", "guy who is shady as hell", "guy who immediately kidnaps us", "guy who literally shows up at our front door to kill us" (I STILL have no clue who the front door guy was, I assumed he was the guy constantly calling Susan in the flashback, but apparently he's not?) and did I mention "guy who likes killing alot of people"? I was honestly expecting some sort of throw-off with Mitzi being hinted at being a parasite, or some sort of conflict like that.<br><br>
<img src="/Main/Blog/MediaLog/clpoint2.gif" width="15"> I really loved the chapter with Susan in the hospital, and her entire interaction with Liz. The reveal with Liz being a ghost, and Doctor X having killed her, I think was so perfect. I knew something was off pretty immediately when the front desk nurse said no one named Liz worked there. I'm a complete sucker for "they were dead all along". However, I will say, I'm a bit sad we don't hear much of Liz later. Or really much of a mention. One of the achievements is also a bit confusing, it's the one where you answer all of Liz's questions correctly. I think the description reads something like "Answer carefully, you might just save her life". Which is just. Y'know. A total lie. Also, what the hell is up with the giant heart we hallucinate in the hospital?? Wtf was the red liquid??? Why can Susan see dead people??? I'm surprised we don't hear much of anything about Doctor X beyond this. He seemed really mysterious, with how Liz talked about him. ..And considering he had that giant ass underground place he was turning people into paintings with.<br><br>
<img src="/Main/Blog/MediaLog/clpoint2.gif" width="15"> I wasn't a fan of Mitzi at first, but she did grow on me. I think in a way I was a bit disappointed the rest of the game was spent with her quest, she felt a bit random in that sense. But thats not to say I didn't like the ending, or where things lead. It was just very unexpected.<br><br>
<img src="/Main/Blog/MediaLog/clpoint2.gif" width="15"> As for The Eye of Adam, I think it suits him that hes a rather anticlimatic villain. I wonder if he and Susan are meant to be opposites of one another. As much as someone (Like Adam) has the capacity to be evil, there is also the capacity (Like Susan) to be caring (Like how she was with Mitzi). It's shocking when we hear about how one person was able to cause so much damage and death, but fail to acknowledge how one person can also do alot of good too.<br><br>
<img src="/Main/Blog/MediaLog/clpoint2.gif" width="15"> I have to say my favourite parts of the game were Susan with her cats. I wish there were more moments with them. Them killing the guy at the door after she plays the piano was incredible. I was hoping her cat at the beginning, Teacup, was going to play a larger role. He does save her during Chapter 4 during the tidbit we get to play as him, and retrieve the key for Susan to unlock herself. But, still..<br><br>
<img src="/Main/Blog/MediaLog/clborder.png" width="455"><br>  
Overall, despite it's small plot flaws, I think The Cat Lady was an amazing experience. The points between supernatural and keeping the protagonist a reasonable human are perfectly balanced, many have praised the writing for how human Susan feels, which I have to agree. She's not overpowered, and the times she does have a upperhand feel actually impactful. She's sarcastic and dry, but not insufferable. She's relatable, but not a blank canvas. I'm glad she got a happy ending, even if many of her loved ones have passed. Often times in society, we are presented that women are "ruined" if they lose their family, or career, or social standing somehow. I really liked the moral that "it's never too late to get better", or atleast try to change.<br><br>
After playing, I discovered that The Cat Lady is apparently apart of a trilogy called "The Devil Came Through Here". I'm very interested in following more of the entries, especially since one seems to relate with one of her neighbors we encounter.</p></td>

  <i>Beatrix LeBeau travels to "The Far, Far Ranch" thousands of light years away from Earth. Wrangling slimes, helping other farmers, and reading mysterious notes left by a previous rancher.</mark></i><br>
  <img src="/Main/Blog/MediaLog/srborder.gif" width="455" height="10"><br>  
  <mark style="background-color: rgb(255, 99, 195); color: rgb(20, 3, 252); mix-blend-mode: screen;"><img src="/Main/Blog/MediaLog/srbullet1.png" width="14"> <i>Genre</i><br><img src="/Main/Blog/MediaLog/srbulletmini.gif" width="15">Farm simulator type game, but instead of managing crops you manage adorable little slimes found across the land. Each slime has a different diet, of things like fruits, veggies, or meat. Feeding them produces "plorts" which you sell for a profit. Allowing you to purchase upgrades for the farm, yourself, and unlock new areas. Don't let this game fool you, although it's cute and bubbly, it does not skimp out on grinding and management. Towards late game you're introduced to the lab, where you can begin building devices to automate the process somewhat. Theres alot more intricacies to this, like building food resources and of course finding the little guys, along with feeding them different plorts to make mega slimes.
  <br><br><img src="/Main/Blog/MediaLog/srbulletmini.gif" width="15">There is also a "rush mode" where you have to speed thru to make as much money as possible. You can extend your time by doing the ranch exchange you normally do in the main game. This not only rewards you with time, but food to feed the giant golden slimes around the map to earn more profit. I was nervous when I got to this part for achievement hunting, I still have a step by step guide I wrote down while I was going thru it. Although it seems a bit daunting, I found rush mode just as fun !<br><br>
  <img src="/Main/Blog/MediaLog/srbullet2.png" width="14"> <i>Style</i><br>Cute and pastel-like ! I'd describe it kind of like a sticker book. Its nice to have a kind of "scientific"ish game not take on a gritty approach. The main stars of the show are the slimes obviously. And they all look perfect in conveying what you need to know about them. Theres a mix of futurism with the tech we use on the Ranch. The landscapes are saturated and detailed. I mostly enjoyed the rock areas with the crystal slimes or radioactive ones.<br><br>
  <img src="/Main/Blog/MediaLog/srbullet3.png" width="14"> <i>Story</i><br>I'll be completely honest. I did not pay a singular crumb of attention to any lore thrown at me. Shit hit me like a brick wall. I really did not care to read the letters sent, and rarely read the ones left around the map. Which is shocking coming from me ! Its not that I dislike the world or its lore, I was just more interested in ranching. I only started caring more towards the end, with the interactions to other ranchers. I really like all three of them. :] Mainly Viktor of course.<br><br></mark>

  <mark style="background-color: rgb(255, 249, 162); color: rgb(41, 184, 5); mix-blend-mode: screen;">This was one of the first games in my Steam library. Some of my achievements for this game date from around its launch. Because of how Steam save data works, I saw my first save file on the list, listing a absurdly early version. It was almost therapeutic in a way to return and finish the game entirely. Nostalgia aside, Slime Rancher is a incredibly fun game mixed with strategy, Pokemon hunting, and good ol farming management. I saw a second iteration has been released, and I already know my return is inevitable.</mark>
