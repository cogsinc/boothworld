<font color="#737789"><p>I wish I was a candle. To give you light when you read, to relax you with a scent, to keep track of time. I wish I was a flower. You'd water me everyday, you'd gaze longingly at me not knowing I am too, you don't think of when I'll die. I wish I was a bookshelf. Full of the things you like and collect, full of knicks and knacks you don't think about but can't seem to be rid of, you'd forget to dust me. And I'd laugh, but you wouldn't know, bookshelves shouldn't laugh. I wish I was just someone useful to you. I wish I wasn't myself. I am selfish. Or maybe I'm shelf-ish? Please don't donate me.
