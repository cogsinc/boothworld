<font color="#737789"><p>Alot of people seem to believe the world has been made worse by the internet. And part of me would say they're right in some ways. But I have to wonder how much of it is just because they don't want to see the unsightly. How they can just live in their gated community and hark at freaks that should only exist in TV shows made for them, by people like them.</p></font>
