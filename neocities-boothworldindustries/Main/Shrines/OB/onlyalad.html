    <p style="text-align: right;"><mark style="background-color: #84b9dd">Starting off incredibly strong with the first song you usually listen to in their discography, (<s>Gee is it hard to get people into this band..</s>) Little Girls wears it's blatant meaning on it's sleeve. 
    <br><br>From a <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/music/features/oingo-boingo-little-girls-music-video-danny-elfman-youtube-a7390881.html" target="_blank">interview with frontman Elfman</a> about the song, stating: "<i>What made me write it? At that point I was just grabbing onto things that popped up in my head and taking characters and singing from their point of view. So whether it be the right wing guy talking about capitalism or the feisty little girl or quasi molester - these were just things that I thought were funny or interesting and I would just kind of jump into the skin of. Often things I wrote were motivated by nothing but the newspaper. I’d read an article and be thinking about something and write a song from that perspective. So it didn’t necessarily reflect me…but it was just fun and I knew it was irreverent. I was out to offend everybody when I started out. Any subject matter I could find that would be offensive I was embracing, so that was just one.</i>”
    <br><br>I really don't have any more commentary on the songs meaning, apart from praying you can take a hint its meant to be mocking and satirical. The song itself I find unfortunately very catchy, and I really like its opening trumpets! They really mastered making you feel guilty for instinctively singing along. This is also some of the few songs that has a music video to accompany it, directed by Danny Elfman's brother, Richard Elfman. I also don't have too much to say about it from the obviousness it's intended to be unsettling and fever dream-like. Its no wonder why this has remained one of their most popular songs. I give it a 5/5.</mark></p>

    <p style="text-align: right;"><mark style="background-color: #84b9dd">Perfect System is another song with a rather obvious meaning. From the perspective of someone living in a dictatorship and singing about how wonderful it is, the alleged "lack of confrontation", and his brothership to others in the system. I moreso find the tone of which this is sung in to be the most telling/interesting. With Elfman sounding tense or like thru gritted teeth. And the most intense part where he yells "I had a operation", likely implying those in the system have some kind of brain transplant to make them this way; and maybe the singer is somewhat self aware of this. Another interesting part is the "<i>I'm in love with you, I know - I'm in love with everyone, too</i>" this part has the most up to interpretation.
    <br><br>The most likely meaning I take is theres a real person he's saying this to, and maybe that "love" is forbidden in this system. So he rationalizes these feelings with "I love everyone in the system, so that includes you too" and is trying to reason with it as just "feelings of brothership". You can also take that maybe he's being *told* hes meant to love this person, so he keeps repeating that "I know". Either way, I think the emotion of "love" is what made the singer snap.
    <br><br>I quite like the sort of erratic beeping-like noises heard in the background at some parts; like a system component failing. Only a Lad has some of their best.. what I like to call, "squiggly" noises. And this song is really a prime example of their erratic earlier sounds. In terms of Only a Lad, I'd have to say this is one of my favourites. In all of their discography, I'd give it a 3.5/5. The part with "we're all brothers in a perfect world" is so good. This song reminds me of Marvin the Martian.</mark></p>

    <p style="text-align: right;"><mark style="background-color: #84b9dd">I see this song as being a cope from the perspective of the singer, who has been heavily alienated/unable to fully fit in any group hes attempted to join or be apart of. While at first glance this might seem like a mocking of those who are heavily into pop subculture or music, theres obvious bias from the singer. With that said, I don't think its a entirely unfounded meaning. I kind of also take it as people who are apart of very "progressive" subcultures not being immune from "us versus them"/group think, and turning away "outsiders". The obvious irony is that in a attempt to maybe save his ego, the singer has become ignorant like those in those subcultures. And he believes he is truly a individualistic "outsider" unlike anyone else now.
    <br><br>In terms of sound, I think this is pleasant. :) I don't have too much to say about it really, but I think the point was to have rather inoffensive/less erratic instruments. Even if I don't go out of my way to listen to this song often, I still like its meaning. So I'd say a 3.5/5.</mark></p>

    <p style="text-align: right;"><mark style="background-color: #84b9dd">I really think this is one of the more underrated songs in the album/their art as a whole. Capitalism is both from the perspective of the capitalist, and someone ranting about them. It doesn't pull any punches with the perspective of the capitalist. And I think the reason this song is still so good is because absolutely nothing has changed in modern era (And likely never will).
    <br><br>The capitalist is guilt tripping, saying "<i>There's nothing wrong with wanting to live nice - Don't make me feel guilty, I'm so tired of hearing you whine.</i>" obviously ignoring where their wealth has accumulated from. Along with obvious jabs about the nature of companies, "<i>And you tell me that we've got to get back, to the struggling masses, whoever they are! - You talk, talk, talk about the suffering and pain,</i>" and how the rich will try to make the worlds problems also seem guilty by the less fortunate, so obviously they aren't to blame. And of course, they get angry when they are finally called out.
    <br><br>This is one of my favourite songs from the album, probably in my top 3. I really like the piano portions, I think it has a unique noise in comparison to the other songs. 5/5 :)</mark></p>
