<p style="background-color: rgb(99, 89, 69);">"Sally Smithson came to town with dreams of children's feet and laughter in a wooden home built by her husband Andrew. But life came not with smiles but with plans of destruction. Andrew worked as a lumberjack - a job with its perils. One day, Andrew's foreman had to pay Sally a visit, forever changing her life. She was alone.</p>
<p style="background-color: rgb(99, 89, 69);">Without food on the table and no other option, Sally had to find a way, but the only employment she could get was at the Crotus Prenn Asylum. Nobody sought employment there unless they were in dire need. Just like Sally. Without any education, she started at the bottom, doing the hard night shift. </p>
<p style="background-color: rgb(99, 89, 69);">Over the years, her mind had reached its limits, two decades of seeing horrid things that violate the eyes. Memories that are re-played every night. Being abused verbally and physically, by people without limits. Sally saw insanity from the outside, just to catch it herself.</p>
<p style="background-color: rgb(99, 89, 69);">Finally she could not take it any more and concepts of purification emerged inside her. She did what she felt was necessary. As the morning staff arrived one day in September - they found over fifty dead patients, lifeless, in their bed along four staff members, also dead.</p>
<p style="background-color: rgb(99, 89, 69);">Only Sally had survived the night, but her mind was gone, rocking back and forth non-stop. Exactly what happened is only known by her, but it seems that some of them had been choked as they had marks around their necks. They got her into an ambulance, but that ambulance never reached the hospital. It was found crashed in a nearby wood, all the staff dead and Sally nowhere to be found."</p>
<p style="background-color: rgb(99, 89, 69);">~Lore description.</p>
<p style="background-color: rgb(99, 89, 69);">She also has additional lore in Tome 6, "Divergence".</p>
<hr style="border-top: 3px groove rgb(145, 137, 120);">

<p style="background-color: rgb(99, 89, 69);">Athough the slowest walking Killer in the game, Nurse makes up with her "blink" ability, titled <font color="#591912">"Spencer's Last Breath"</font>. Nurse is like a ghost, and able to teleport thru walls and floors, at the cost of being fatigued for a second afterwards. She can surprise Survivors by quickly zipping to them.</p>
<p style="background-color: rgb(99, 89, 69);">Nurse has three special perks native to her, being: <font color="#591912">"A Nurse's Calling"</font>, which allows her to see those healing nearby. <font color="#591912">"Stridor"</font>, which increases the noises of breathing and pain Survivors make. And <font color="#591912">"Thanatophobia"</font>, which slows Survivor progress for every one injured or hooked.</p>
<p style="background-color: rgb(99, 89, 69);">She was first introduced in the free DLC titled "The Last Breath", released August 18th 2016.</p>
<hr style="border-top: 3px groove rgb(145, 137, 120);">

<p style="background-color: rgb(99, 89, 69);">My loadout for Nurse consists of <font color="#591912">"Unrelenting"</font>, <font color="#591912">"Sloppy Butcher"</font>, <font color="#591912">"Scourge Hook: Monstrous Shrine"</font>, and either <font color="#591912">"A Nurse's Calling"</font> or <font color="#591912">"Lightborn"</font>. <font color="#591912">"Unrelenting"</font> is great for her slower speed and recovering from missed hits. <font color="#591912">"Sloppy Butcher"</font> and <font color="#591912">"A Nurse's Calling"</font> work great together for finding Survivors that think they got away.</p>
<p style="background-color: rgb(99, 89, 69);">I also like using the <font color="#591912">"Torn Bookmark"</font> and <font color="#591912">"Ataxic Respiration"</font> or <font color="#591912">"Fragile Freeze"</font> for add-ons.</p>
<p style="background-color: rgb(99, 89, 69);">Nurse was the first Killer I decided to play as, I'm unfortunately predictable with Nurse-oriented characters. I was unaware of her apparent skill ceiling, it did take me a while to get used to how far her blinks can go. (..And avoiding teleporting to another floor by accident.) My biggest problem was getting less stingy with her blinks. Although funnily I found that people expecting blinks tends to mess with their predictability.</p>

<p style="background-color: rgb(99, 89, 69);">Some of my favourite cosmetics for her would have to be the red <font color="#591912">"On Probation"</font>, <font color="#591912">"WW2 Uniform"</font>, <font color="#591912">"Miss Smithson"</font> and her mask from Twisted Masquerade.</p>
<p style="background-color: rgb(99, 89, 69);">Although Nurse is one of my most played Killers, I'm not the biggest fan of her outfits. I prefer to keep her face masked; but I do like her red hair. I also funnily don't like when her arms are exposed, it feels weirdly bare especially in first person.</p>

<hr style="border-top: 3px groove rgb(170, 147, 133);">
<p style="background-color: rgb(139, 118, 109);">"Born in the dust-ridden Badlands of the American Midwest, Caleb Quinn was son to struggling Irish immigrants. On the edge of the frontier, sickness, famine, and death were common sights, and pioneers contended for whatever scraps they could claim while tycoons feasted. Caleb's father, once an engineer, had few options to ply his trade as businesses posted a common sign: No Irish Need Apply. His antiquated tools laid untouched for years until Caleb uncovered them. Noticing his son's interest in the trade, he gifted him his old wrench.</p>
<p style="background-color: rgb(139, 118, 109);">The devices Caleb made under his father's guidance had quaint applications, but when his father was away, they took a grim turn. He hid plans for a mask that would gouge barbed needles into a human's eyes and rip them from their sockets, complete with sketches of it fitted on boys who bullied him.</p>
<p style="background-color: rgb(139, 118, 109);">With age, Caleb's engineering abilities became marketable and employers put their discrimination aside. Henry Bayshore, the owner of United West Rail, hired him.</p>
<p style="background-color: rgb(139, 118, 109);">Caleb first invented a gun that shot railroad spikes into the ground. Next, he made a steam-powered tunnelling drill. But as Bayshore feigned indifference, the devices began turning up at other companies, the patents stolen from Caleb and sold.</p>
<p style="background-color: rgb(139, 118, 109);">A familiar sensation coursed through Caleb's blood, feeding the sharp pain in his heart. Rage overwhelming him, he burst into Bayshore's office and smashed his face into a bloody stew. As he was pulled away, he pushed his specialised gun to his boss' gut and squeezed the trigger. A railroad spike ploughed through skin and viscera, nailing Bayshore to his desk.</p>
<p style="background-color: rgb(139, 118, 109);">The only thing that saved Caleb from hanging was Bayshore's unlikely survival. For fifteen years, Caleb was confined to Hellshire Penitentiary, the nation's first private prison. In a fortress of illiterate convicts, he found an unlikely friend in the educated prison warden. He designed torture devices for him and in return received extra meals. After a time, the warden offered to commute his sentence. He spoke of something greater than monetary wealth — political capital — and that his connections could have Bayshore framed and rotting behind bars for life. He had only one request: make him rich. Fill the prison. Use ingenuity to bring outlaws in alive.</p>
<p style="background-color: rgb(139, 118, 109);">Caleb returned to his workshop, and with a few modifications emerged with something new — the speargun. The first trial occurred when a thief robbed a Chinese laundry. Seizing on the opportunity, Caleb unleashed his prototype. Metal joints screeched as the spike shot forward, gouging into the target's abdomen. But as the spear tugged, it caught the thief's intestines, and, with an ungodly sound, yanked them onto the dusty road. After several iterations, the disembowelments dwindled, but Caleb had already earned his new nickname: The Deathslinger.</p>
<p style="background-color: rgb(139, 118, 109);">Looking to protect his asset, the prison warden pulled strings and released Irish inmates to form Caleb's posse. The Hellshire Gang was born. For six years, they roamed the country collecting wanted outlaws for the prison, fulfilling their end of the bargain. After a bloody battle at Glenvale, Caleb caught notice of a newspaper headline: Henry Bayshore Purchases Hellshire Penitentiary. In the picture, a disfigured Bayshore proudly shook the warden's hand. Caleb's heart pounded with rage, blood swelling as if it would burst from his veins. He'd been sold out, a pawn in a rich man's game.</p>
<p style="background-color: rgb(139, 118, 109);">The Hellshire Gang pledged their loyalty to Caleb and called for the warden's head. In a thundering gallop, they smashed through the prison entrance, shrieking like bloodthirsty marauders. A guard raised his pistol, but hesitated. A spear punctured his chest. Caleb grabbed the man's head and slammed it against a prison cell until it spilled through the bars.</p>
<p style="background-color: rgb(139, 118, 109);">Reaching the warden's office, Caleb kicked the door and was met with a fortunate sight — it wasn't only the prison warden who cowered in a corner, but Henry Bayshore. Overpowered with rage, Caleb rushed to Bayshore, beating, bludgeoning, tearing at his flesh. The man's blood dripped from his face, crimson pooling at his feet. The Hellshire Gang swarmed the warden, snapping bones with each kick.</p>
<p style="background-color: rgb(139, 118, 109);">With the two men broken and begging for death, the posse dragged them to the commons, where they were left to the growing crowd of prisoners.</p>
<p style="background-color: rgb(139, 118, 109);">Soaked in blood and sweat, Caleb hobbled to his old cell, hardly paying notice to Bayshore's screams. He sat on the bed's edge as drops of blood ran from his fingertips. A thick, unnatural fog streamed through the barred window. He pulled out his old wrench, cracked and rusted, and ran a thumb along the metal, regarding it with faded eyes. He couldn't remember when it came into his possession. He didn't care to remember. At his feet, he saw a dusty path, and, at its end, silhouettes of all who had done him wrong: the boys who bullied him, the executives who took advantage of him, and, again... Henry Bayshore. Emerging from a fog were the tools to dispose of them — unforgiving steel hooks, brilliant and beautiful in their simplicity. Pain tore through his leg as he stood, but he endured, pushing onwards, walking the dusty path, leaving a trail of blood flowing behind him."</p>

<p style="background-color: rgb(139, 118, 109);">Armed with his self-made ability titled <font color="#f4b995">"The Redeemer"</font>, Deathslinger is a range based killer. Aiming down his sights, he can spear and reel in Survivors who don't respect his line of sight. Targets who break free of his chain are inflicted with a deep wound, taking extra time to heal.</p>
<p style="background-color: rgb(139, 118, 109);">Deathslinger has three special perks native to him, being: <font color="#f4b995">"Dead Man's Switch"</font>, which locks up and marks a generator Survivors stop repairing after hooking someone. <font color="#f4b995">"Gearhead"</font>, after a Survivor loses a health state he can see the aura of anyone performing a good skill check for the next 30 seconds. And <font color="#f4b995">"Hex: Retribution"</font>, which inflicts oblivious on Survivors cleansing or blessing a totem, and then reveals their auras for 15 seconds.</p>

The two hexes work together to punish anyone during end game, and <font color="#f4b995">"Dead Man's Switch"</font> is great for information. Occasionally I do swap it for <font color="#f4b995">"A Nurse's Calling"</font> however, great for after causing deep wound.</p>
<p style="background-color: rgb(139, 118, 109);">I also use <font color="#f4b995">"Iridescent Coin"</font>, <font color="#f4b995">"Barbed Wire"</font>, <font color="#f4b995">"Warden's Keys"</font>, or <font color="#f4b995">"Wanted Poster"</font> for add-ons. I think they're all really good.</p>
<p style="background-color: rgb(139, 118, 109);">Deathslinger was the first character I decided to unlock after grinding shards! I was immediately drawn to him, and hes probably my favourite character in the game. It took me a while to get used to the slight delay of his shots, but hes just so much fun to play as. I also love getting Slingers in my lobby when I'm Survivor. <3</p>

<p style="background-color: rgb(112, 98, 77);">"Philip Ojomo came to this country without anything than hope for a new beginning. He was happy as he got offered a job at Autohaven Wreckers. A small scrap yard where bribed cops turned a blind eye for the somewhat shady business that took place.</p>
<p style="background-color: rgb(112, 98, 77);">Ojomo didn't care. He had seen criminal activity up close in his homeland and as long as he didn't get involved, he let things be. He just fixed cars and handled the crusher. Something he did really well. A car went in and a small, metallic cube came out.</p>
<p style="background-color: rgb(112, 98, 77);">It was not until one gloomy day that he, just by accident, saw some blood coming from one of the un-crushed cars. As he opened the trunk he found a young man, gagged and with tied hands with panic filled eyes. Ojomo freed the man who managed to run ten feet before Ojomo's boss stopped him and slit his throat. As Ojomo demanded answers he got explained to him that he'd been nothing more than a simple executioner as more or less every car had a soul in them as this was a "service" the scrap yard provided to certain "clients".</p>
<p style="background-color: rgb(112, 98, 77);">Ojomo snapped and went ballistic. He threw his boss in the crusher and let it slowly compress, as the head stuck out, Ojomo grabbed it and pulled head and spine out of the body. Then he left and was never seen again."</p>

Information perks really shine for his "hit and run" play-style. His speed while cloaked is a great tool for swapping focus and keeping pressure.</p>
<p style="background-color: rgb(112, 98, 77);">For add-ons, you really can't go wrong with any. But I mainly use <font color="#fcf1cf">"Shadow Dance ~ Blood"</font>, <font color="#fcf1cf">"Swift Hunt ~ Blood"</font>. Both of his iridescent add-ons are amazing, but I tend to run out quickly.</p>
<p style="background-color: rgb(112, 98, 77);">Wraith was the other Killer I started out playing as, when I wanted something less intensive as Nurse. And still I find him a consistent choice thats incredibly fun; I have a bit of a sentimental attachment to him now- People can really underestimate him, his body blocking can catch people off guard, and hes quick to move or destroy loops. I really want to try <font color="#fcf1cf">"Bamboozle"</font> on him.</p>
