<!-- INTRO -->
<h2 class="subheader"><mark><i><b>Introduction ~</i></b></mark></h2>

<div class="posttext">
<p style="margin:0px 0px 0px 0px;">Having already been in the band "Buster" and releasing a single prior under this name in 1984 (Which is also included in this album), "First Night" would be the first album released by Robert Fennah now joined by his brother Alan Fennah. Released in 1986 under the label "Cold Harbour Records".</p>

<p>First Night takes a mixture of almost mystical victorian like themes as heard in "Concertina Ballerina" and "Valley Of Evergreen" mixed in with heartache of titles like "Strangers In Love" and "Emotional Disaster" to create both a wonderful return and a new start for the brothers in music. The use of synths and eletronics in this album, although mandatory for every song from the 80s, helps achieve this hypnotic almost foreign feeling mixed in with the skillful guitar work of rock. Its like a glimpse into another world, or hearing the woes of another, with each song feeling like its own little story.</p>

"Waiting in the wings,<br>
waiting in the wings.<br>
The pressure closing in,<br>
and this is the first night."</i></p>

<p><i>"Everyone cries<br>
when you're up there alive,<br>
and it's alright.<br>
People and faces,<br>
are lost without trace,<br>
in the white light.<br>
Rivers of sound,<br>
watch the curtain come down,<br>
on the first night."</i></p>

<p>(Note: The lyrics are shortened as the first and second verses repeat thru out the song.) The title track of this album opens in a certainly theatrical way. The theme of this song in particular seems to be related to a stage performance, with "waiting in the wings" being commonly defined as "someone to be of use later - not yet active or important - or not yet ready to appear" and being used alot in theatre. "First night" in of itself could mean the phrase of "first night of a play". This is also seen in the lyric "<i>Watch the curtain come down on the first night.</i>" And finally, "white light" likely refers to a stage spotlight.</p>

<p>I do enjoy "First Night", but I have to say it is a little repetitve after its first few listens. I wish it had just a little more lyrics, or something more to work with in comparisons to the other songs on this album. Although it should be noted the version of "First Night" used in this album is specifically labelled "First Night (Long ver)" which likely contributes to this feeling. Nonetheless, "First Night" establishes a good opening.</p>

Misty mornings with fragrance in the air,<br>
sounds of laughter still ringing in my ears.<br>
Silver raindrops, they washed away my fears."</i></p>

<p><i>"And I'm waiting for my dream.<br>
Yes, I'm waiting for my dream to come true."</i></p>

<p><i>"What a dream I had, it opened up my eyes.<br>
I do believe I saw the glimpse of paradise.<br>
A yellow songbird sang the haunting melody,<br>

<p><i>"And I'm waiting for my dream.<br>

yes, I'm waiting for my dream to come true.<br>
And I'm waiting for my dream,<br>
yes, I'm waiting for my dream to come true."</i></p>


<p>"What A Dream" carries a almost odd sinster tone to me, unbeknownst to the listener what the singers "dream" is he so desperately wants. I sometimes even get the idea the singer is more "planning" something as he "waits for his dream to come true". The use of the deep hum in the background is what leads me to this theory. And also, this is really beginning to show the more "mystical" elements of the album I mentioned in the introduction. This song feels like finding a waterfall in the depths of a forest.</p>

<p>Overall, "What A Dream" is a short and sweet simple song.</p>

when your ego is in bloom,<br>

follow a simple instruction,<br>
and see how it crumbles your soul."</i></p>

<p><i>"Take a bucket and fill it with water,<br>
put your hand in it up to your wrist,<br>
pull it out and the hole that remains there,<br>
is the measure of how much you'll be missed."</i></p>

<p><i>"You may splash on your wish when you enter,<br>
you may stare up the water galore,<br>
but just stop for a moment,<br>

<p><i>"There is no indispensable man.<br>
There is no indispensable man.<br>
There is no indispensable man.<br>
There is no indispensable man."</i></p>

<p>On the flip side of songs in this album that carry a more "magical" feeing, we get our first more what I like to call "human" side of the songs. The word "indispensable" is to mean "absolutely neccessary or essential". I feel this song is about humbling the listener/subject. The "bucket of water" seems like a metaphor, telling the man to stick his hand into the bucket and presumably splash it, or that is he careless and he is splashing the water, causing it to be empty or losing a large amount of its contents. And that is "how much (other people) you will be missed". The singer doesn't want the subject to lose his pride or ego with the ending lyrics "<i>Well, the moral of this is quite simple, you just do the best you can. Be proud, but always remember there is no indispensable man.</i>". And is trying to maybe speak to a more self absorbed subject and get him to see other people to his level, and not see them as accessories to himself?</p>

<p>I'll be honest- I actually didn't like this title for a bit! But its one of my favorites, it feels like a melanchonic summer day, or like waking up after a dream and seeing someone you haven't talked to in years; That you wish were better.</p>

<p><i>"Strangers in love.<br>
Strangers in love.<br>
Strangers in love.<br>
Strangers in love."</i></p>

<p>I get two meanings from "Strangers In Love". The first story I derive from this song, is about a strained relationship that might be on the rocks from a broken promise or accidentally hurting one of the parties, hence "<i>I was a fool for sure, when I promised you more.</i>" And because of that, they now feel they don't know each other and are "strangers in love" or the desire to start over as strangers; but still love each other and yearn for what they once had. This also goes with the lyric "<i>Walk in and close the door. But nothing has changed, its still the same for you and I.</i>" which might be the feeling they can't "go back/take back" the things they said. Or they can't pretend to be strangers to start over, or maybe are neglecting the original issue.</p>

<p>My other idea, was that this is about two lovers who fell in love quickly and don't know each other very well and its causing them problems. Which also fits "<i>I was a fool for sure, when I promised you more.</i>" and perhaps even "<i>Your illusion helps you live hand in hand with our own confusion.</i>" that they don't know alot about each other and are jumping to quick promises, and finding more out about the other that makes them question their love. And the "illusion" being the idea they built of each other in their head thats crumbling as they get closer, or maybe even further apart.</p>

<p>"Strangers In Love" is arguably, fighting "Concertina Ballerina" in terms of my favorite song on this album and perhaps of their entire discography. "Concertina Ballerina", as you'll read soon, was my first introduction. But this song made me fall in love completely. This song feels like a deep ache in the chest, a yearning that keeps you up at night, or a desire to "return to the way things were, as strangers.". Like thinking back to a bad relationship and wondering if things could've been different. But on the other side, this song makes me feel very romantic. When I have crushes on people, I always have the thought of "I want to get closer". I feel like a stranger in love.</p>

<p>"Concertina Ballerina" takes after the play "Harlequinade". As evident of Harlequin being the main character. And although not named, Columbine is presumed to be the girl Harlequin of this song is in love with. I feel this song takes a more "darker" approach to the story (Of which is a comedy actually!) With Harlequin being deeply captivated by Columbine, to the point his love, perhaps bordering on obsession, is tearing him apart. It should be noted that in the original story, the conflict comes from Columbines father, Pantaloon, disapproving of Harlequin. But its not stated in the song if this is the reason for Harlequins difficulty in telling her, or that he can't be with her at all because of her father. It should be noted that (According to the wikipedia page atleast) Columbine is <i>not</i> depicted in the play with a mask. And is actually the only character without a mask. This is likely just be a simple error or artistic choice however and probably doesn't mean its a different character from Columbine.</p>

<p>"Concertina Ballerina" was the first song that introduced me to Alternative Radio after a old friend sent it to me. It was truly the first of its kind that I heard and it has such a unique quality to it that drew me in. Anyways- The song itself, as I mentioned earlier, might take a more "darker" approach to the original story of "Harlequinade". Accompanied by this tracks heavy organ and romantic instruments. It feels like a dark circus, a damning dance, and a slow descent into madness as Harlequin contemplates what to do about his feelings. Like Columbine is a ballerina on a music box in his palm he is helplessly infatuated with.</p>

<p>(You can also find me talking about this song under another shrine of mine, for <a href="/Main/Shrines/Yume/Prester/prestervirgil">Prester Virgil</a> either under "Labhunter" or "Music".)</p>

<p><i>"Harmony."</i></p></p>

<p>Another song I have two ideas for what their story is- and perhaps even the same story. "Harmony" might be a double meaning of that the singer is in love with his music, and that his music is his reason for living. But hes struggling to write lyrics "<i>Poetry, it doesn't always rhyme.</i>" and "<i>Stop hesitating, make it easy for me.</i>". But also "Harmony" is a girl, or perhaps him personifying his music. Hes trying to understand why he can't come up with a harmony, and is asking her to tell him whats wrong: "<i>Speak your heart, the truth is love itself.</i>", "<i>Well what is wrong, what goes on in your head?</i>", and the lyric "<i>After the winter, the sun returns again.</i>" to me feels like some type of creative block hes having. And he wants his sun, Harmony, to return to him. Or, alternatively, that possibly he has a lover named "Harmony" that he sees as inspiration for his music. And hes having problems with her, and its affecting his ability to make music.</p>

<p>I don't have too much to say about this track, it tells a sweet story and has obviously stellar instrumentals. Its just the lyrics in some areas, the singing, feels a tad (Just a smidge) off.</p>

It brought her fame and fortune, and a life of luxury.<br>
Her friends were left behind, she didn't have the time.<br>

So how come they never win? How come we're witnessing one more emotional disaster?<br>
One more emotional disaster.<br>
One more emotional disaster."</i></p>

<p>(<s>Finally a song on this album with a clear cut story!</s>) "Emotional Disaster" speaks for itself in its lyrics. A woman named Jamie became a successful actress, but met a abusive man who slowly destroyed her into a shell of her former self. The only part I can really add my two cents on, is I feel the singer himself is a friend of Jamie or someone who knew her personally. Who saw her deteriorate and become "another emotional disaster" like many other stars do. And is upset in the lyrics "<i>How come they never win? How come we're witnessing one more emotional disaster?</i>" that maybe he feels angry and confused that no one stepped in to help Jamie. Or that, with her being a celebrity, people were just using her for paparazzi and headlines of her demise.</p>

<p>"Emotional Disaster" is a simple tale, which is one of this bands many strong points. Telling a story, like a little glimpse into another world. This song feels as though, if we go off of the theory this song is from the perspective of someone who knew Jamie, that hes playing his solo guitar perhaps to himself. Or telling the tale of Jamie to someone else.</p>

<p>Also, I'm not entirely sure what "<i>She almost lost the three.</i>" means in the lyrics? I originally thought the lyrics were "She almost got the dream" but according to both versions of this song on Spotify (Since I couldn't find the lyrics online elsewhere) this is what they say, and its the closest sounding.</p>

Never never in the world did I ever see,<br>

<p><i>"Everybody in the valley of Evergreen,<br>
Is living in the very echoes of time.<br>
Everyone within the valley of Evergreen,<br>
Sees rivers of moonlight,<br>
Wash away day bright."</i></p>

<p><i>"Never never in the valley of Evergreen,<br>
Ever ever is it quite as it seems.<br>
Never never in the world did I ever see,<br>
Mirror ball sunlight,<br>
Dancing at midnight.<br>

<p><i>"And I was alone when I gave up my life for the country.<br>
(And the captain was calling.)<br>
But I didn't mind, 'cause I gave up my life for the country.<br>

<p>This song is the most interesting of the album I feel, it feels almost like a distorted memory or someones dying concsious trying to tell themselves that the death is worth it. But backtrack a little- this song seems to be from the point of view from a soldier of sorts, who dies from perhaps a ambush: "<i>(And it came without a warning.)</i>" This track borders between the more realistic elements of other songs and the more fantasy type themes of others. My personal theory (Well- all of these are my personal opinions. But this ones the most out there I feel and the most speculative.) is that the "Valley Of Evergreen" is one of two things.</p>

<p>Either, the soldier saw the "Valley Of Evergreen" and it was so fantastical, he couldn't explain what he saw, and it killed him or unleashed something into the world. Or that the "Valley Of Evergreen" itself is a metaphor for heaven or a heavenly place, meaning to play off of the phrase "Valley Of Death"/"Valley Of The Shadow Of Death" which is in the Christian bible and also used as the name for multiple atrocities. The verse from the bible saying: "<i>Psalm 23:4 Even though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death, I will fear no evil, for You are with me; Your rod and Your staff, they comfort me.</i>" so perhaps the "Valley Of Evergreen" is a type of Eden opposite to the "Valley Of Death".</p>

<p>Furthermore, the soldier might have seen this place during his dying breaths as a vision. There are multiple background lyrics in the song which can alude to this like "<i>(And the captain was calling.)</i>" and "<i>(Our front line is falling.)</i>" as some type of either background noise or his concsious panicking. And finally the lyric "<i>(And I wish that I could fly away.)</i>" that the soldier is happy hes dying. And trying to say his death is dignified, and that hes fine dying alone, and that hes fine no one will cry, because its "for the country he loves".</p>

<p>"Valley Of Evergreen" was also the bands first single, and a great way to end of the album on almost a somber tone. With the use of drums in the background similar to a soldiers march, it is also the "long version" of this song like "First Night" is. But I gave it a bit of a higher rating then "First Night" because I felt it suited the song more, and it had more instrumental variance and more lyrics. In a way, the longer version of this song feels like a slow drawn out final breath of the soldier.</p>
