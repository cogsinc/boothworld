<p>Released June 14th 2016, "Dead by Daylight" is a online horror game developed by Behaviour Interactive. Players take the role of being a "Survivor" or a "Killer", both able to equip special "perks" to change their strategies.</p>

<p>Survivors are teamed up into a total of four, and their goal is to repair all five generators spread across the map, and power the exit gates to escape. Survivors can bring special items with them before the start of a match, such as: A med-kit to heal other Survivors quicker, a toolbox to speed up repairs faster, a flashlight to temporarily stun the Killer (Or perform "saves" to make the Killer drop a picked up Survivor), and a map or a key to see certain things thru out the map.</p>
<p>Survivors have multiple tools with them to evade the Killer. Such as hiding in lockers, vaulting over windows, stunning them with pallets placed around the map, or performing cheeky maneuvers with body blocking and terrain.</p>
<p>If only one Survivor is left alive, a "hatch" will spawn somewhere on the map for them to possibly make a final escape. This hatch can be closed by the Killer if found, and the exit gates will have to be powered.</p>

<p>Killers are the lone antagonist in the match. All Killers have a different special ability, letting them hunt down Survivors in various ways. Their goal is to hit a Survivor twice, causing them to fall down, and bring them to a crude meat hook to be "sacrificed". Killers have to hook a Survivor thrice (If they are saved) before they are out of the game for good.</p>
<p>Most Killers have a faster walk speed then Survivors, but can be stunned by having pallets thrown in their faces, or being blinded by a flashlight. Killers have a "terror radius" that causes the Survivors to hear their heartbeat fasten as the Killer draws closer. Killers can also break pallets (Once they are thrown down) or damage generators to slightly regress their progress. They are able to see all generators on the map, unlike the Survivors; and the location of hooks once they have picked somebody up.</p>

<p>For general gameplay that both sides can participate in, players can progress their selected character in the "blood web", which functions like a skill tree almost. Once the selected character has reached level 50, their "Prestige" will be levelled up. Prestiging a character will let you use their special perks on other characters, (But only Survivors can use other Survivor perks, and vice versa for Killers) give special cosmetics, and of course bragging rights.</p>
<p>New events and chapters are released frequently, some with licensed characters such as Michael Myers or Leatherface. Players can unlock new characters by gaining "iridescent shards" thru levelling (or purchasing them outright) but licensed characters must be bought with "auric cells" using real money.</p>
<p>Players can also view "The Archives" and select "tome" challenges. Challenges are things such as "Hook x amount of Survivors" or "Deplete x amount of med-kits", or can be special to a specific character like "Catch x amount of Survivors as The Trapper". Completing challenges gives the player blood points and new lore tidbits to various characters. Some tomes are time/seasonal limited. Tomes are also tied to "The Rift" which functions similar to a battle pass, but I'll be honest that I don't really care about the rift because I refuse to spend money on this godforsaken game.</p>
