<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OS-tan#" target="_blank">OS-tan</a> - "OS-tans are moe anthropomorphic personifications of popular operating systems, originating on the Japanese imageboard Futaba Channel. The designs of the OS-tans, which were created by various amateur Japanese artists, are typically female; for example, the personifications of Microsoft Windows operating systems are often depicted as sisters of varying ages. The -tan element in the term is a hypocoristic suffix in Japanese that implies extremely youthful endearment."</p>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Wikipe-tan" target="_blank">Wikipe-tan</a> - "Wikipe-tan (Japanese: ウィキペたん) is a personification of Wikipedia created in January 2006 by Japanese editor Kasuga. She is an unofficial mascot of Wikipedia and is used at several WikiProjects. The -tan in "Wikipe-tan" is an affectionate suffix, in the form of a Japanese honorific. Like the OS-tans, she is a product of moe anthropomorphism."</p>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moe_anthropomorphism#" target="_blank">Moe Anthropomorphism</a> - "Moe anthropomorphism (Japanese: 萌え擬人化, Hepburn: moe gijinka) is a form of anthropomorphism in anime, manga, and games where moe qualities are given to non-human beings (such as animals, plants, supernatural entities and fantastical creatures), objects, concepts, or phenomena. In addition to moe features, moe anthropomorphs are also characterized by their accessories, which serve to emphasize their original forms before anthropomorphosis. The characters here, usually in a kind of cosplay, are drawn to represent an inanimate object or popular consumer product. Part of the humor of this personification comes from the personality ascribed to the character (often satirical) and the sheer arbitrariness of characterizing a variety of machines, objects, and even physical places as cute."</p>
