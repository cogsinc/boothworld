<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-concept#" target="_blank">Self Concept</a> - Psychology. "In the psychology of self, one's self-concept (also called self-construction, self-identity, self-perspective or self-structure) is a collection of beliefs about oneself. Generally, self-concept embodies the answer to the question 'Who am I?'."</p>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Handkerchief_code" target="_blank">Handkerchief Code</a> - Community, queer. "The handkerchief code (also known as the hanky code, the bandana code, and flagging) is a system of color-coded cloth handkerchief or bandanas for non-verbally communicating one's interests in sexual activities and fetishes."</p>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cass_identity_model" target="_blank">Cass Identity Model</a> - Societal, psychology, queer. "The Cass identity model is one of the fundamental theories of LGBT identity development, developed in 1979 by Vivienne Cass. This model was one of the first to treat LGBT people as normal in a heterosexist society and in a climate of homophobia and biphobia instead of treating homosexuality and bisexuality themselves as a problem. Cass described a process of six stages of LGBT identity development. While these stages are sequential, some people might revisit stages at different points in their lives."</p>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Labeling_theory" target="_blank">Labeling Theory</a> - Societal, psychology. "Labeling theory posits that self-identity and the behavior of individuals may be determined or influenced by the terms used to describe or classify them. It is associated with the concepts of self-fulfilling prophecy and stereotyping. Labeling theory holds that deviance is not inherent in an act, but instead focuses on the tendency of majorities to negatively label minorities or those seen as deviant from standard cultural norms. The theory was prominent during the 1960s and 1970s, and some modified versions of the theory have developed and are still currently popular. Stigma is defined as a powerfully negative label that changes a person's self-concept and social identity."</p>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtue_signalling" target="_blank">Virtue Signalling</a> - Societal, political. "Virtue signalling is a pejorative neologism for the expression of a disingenuous moral viewpoint with the intent of communicating good character. From the perspective of psychology, it is a low-cost means of signalling or advertising one's supposed values."</p>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moral_panic" target="_blank">Moral Panic</a> - Societal, political. "A moral panic is a widespread feeling of fear, often an irrational one, that some evil person or thing threatens the values, interests, or well-being of a community or society. It is 'the process of arousing social concern over an issue', usually perpetuated by moral entrepreneurs and mass media coverage, and exacerbated by politicians and lawmakers. Moral panic can give rise to new laws aimed at controlling the community."</p>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luxury_belief" target="_blank">Luxury Belief</a> - Societal, political. "A luxury belief is an idea or opinion that confers status on the upper class at little cost, while often inflicting costs on the lower class. The term is often associated with the phenomena where privileged individuals, often disconnected from the lived experiences of impoverished and marginalized people, hold political and social beliefs that signal their elite status, yet impose consequences on those with the least influence."</p>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Champagne_socialist" target="_blank">Champagne Socialist</a> - Societal, political. "Champagne socialist is a political term commonly used in the United Kingdom. It is a popular epithet that implies a degree of hypocrisy, and it is closely related to the concept of the liberal elite. The phrase is used to describe self-identified anarchists, communists, and socialists whose luxurious lifestyles, metonymically including consumption of champagne, are ostensibly in conflict with their political beliefs."</p>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baizuo" target="_blank">Baizou</a> - Societal, political. "Baizuo (Chinese: 白左; pinyin: báizuǒ, Mandarin pronunciation: [pǎɪ.tswò]; literally "white left") is a derogatory Chinese neologism used to refer to Western liberals and leftists and to their values, especially in relation to refugee issues and social problems. The term originated in the 2010s, probably initially to mock American and Western communists who traveled to China to support the communist revolution and has since come into widespread use due to Chinese netizens' criticism of Western liberal to leftist ideologies and of European governments, particularly Angela Merkel and the German government, for their alleged over-tolerance during the refugee crisis, and to netizens' praise of Donald Trump's populist policies. The term has begun to be widely used in English as well, most notably by American conservatives."</p>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Folie_%C3%A0_deux" target="_blank">Folie à Deux</a> - Psychology, mental health. "Folie à deux (French for "folly of two"), also known as shared psychosis or shared delusional disorder (SDD), is a rare psychiatric syndrome in which symptoms of a delusional belief, and sometimes hallucinations, are "transmitted" from one individual to another."</p>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Think_of_the_children" target="_blank">"Think of The Children"</a> - Societal, political. "'Think of the children' (also 'What about the children?') is a cliché that evolved into a rhetorical tactic. In the literal sense, it refers to children's rights (as in discussions of child labor). In debate, it is a plea for pity that is used as an appeal to emotion, and therefore may become a logical fallacy."</p>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radical_chic" target="_blank">Radical Chic</a> - Societal, political. "Radical chic is the fashionable practice of upper-class people associating with politically radical people and causes. Coined in the 1970 article "Radical Chic: That Party at Lenny's" by journalist Tom Wolfe, the term has become widely used in languages such as American English, French, and Italian. Unlike dedicated activists, revolutionaries, or dissenters, those who engage in "radical chic" remain frivolous political agitators—ideologically invested in their cause of choice only so far as it advances their social standing."</p>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Woke" target="_blank">Woke</a> - Societal, political. "Woke is an adjective derived from African-American Vernacular English (AAVE) meaning 'alert to racial prejudice and discrimination'. Beginning in the 2010s, it came to encompass a broader awareness of social inequalities such as racial injustice, sexism, and denial of LGBT rights. Woke has also been used as shorthand for some ideas of the American Left involving identity politics and social justice, such as white privilege and reparations for slavery in the United States."</p>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Escapism" target="_blank">Escapism</a> - Psychology, societal. "Escapism is mental diversion from unpleasant aspects of daily life, typically through activities involving imagination or entertainment. Escapism also may be used to occupy one's self away from persistent feelings of depression or general sadness."</p>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Victimology" target="_blank">Victimology</a> - Psychology, societal. "Victimology is the study of victimization, including the psychological effects on victims, the relationship between victims and offenders, the interactions between victims and the criminal justice system—that is, the police and courts, and corrections officials—and the connections between victims and other social groups and institutions, such as the media, businesses, and social movements."</p>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Friend_of_Dorothy" target="_blank">Friend of Dorothy</a> - Community, queer. "A 'friend of Dorothy' (FOD) is a euphemism for a gay man, first used in LGBT slang. Stating that, or asking if someone is a friend of Dorothy, is a furtive way of suggesting sexual orientation while avoiding hostility. The term was likely based on the character Dorothy Gale of the Oz series of novels, which have been interpreted as including much queer subtext. Actress Judy Garland, who portrayed Dorothy in the 1939 Wizard of Oz film, is considered a gay icon. Writer and critic Dorothy Parker is thought to be another potential origin of the term. The 'friend of Dorothy' euphemism was commonly used throughout the 20th century, but its use has declined in recent decades as LGBT acceptance has advanced."</p>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LGBT_slang#" target="_blank">LGBT Slang</a> - Community, queer. "LGBT slang, LGBT speak, queer slang, or gay slang is a set of English slang lexicon used predominantly among LGBTQ+ people. It has been used in various languages since the early 20th century as a means by which members of the LGBTQ+ community identify themselves and speak in code with brevity and speed to others. The acronym LGBT was popularized in the 1990s and stands for Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, and Transgender. It may refer to anyone who is non-heterosexual or non-cisgender, instead of exclusively to people who are lesbian, gay, bisexual, or transgender. To recognize this inclusion, a popular variant, LGBTQ, adds the letter Q for those who identify as queer or are questioning their sexual or gender identity."</p>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ball_culture#" target="_blank">Ball Culture</a> - Community, queer. "The Ballroom scene (also known as the Ballroom community, Ballroom culture, or just Ballroom) is an African-American and Latino underground LGBTQ+ subculture. Its origins can be found in drag balls of the mid-19th century United States, such as those hosted by William Dorsey Swann, a formerly enslaved Black man in Washington D.C.. By the early 20th century, integrated drag balls were popular in cities such as New York, Chicago, New Orleans, Baltimore, and Philadelphia. In the mid-20th century, as a response to racism in integrated drag spaces, the balls evolved into house ballroom, where Black and Latino attendees could 'walk' in a variety of categories for trophies and cash prizes. Most participants in ballroom belong to groups known as 'houses,' where chosen families of friends form relationships and communities separate from their families of origin, from which they may be estranged. The influence of ballroom culture can be seen in dance, language, music, and popular culture, and the community still exists today."</p>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HIV/AIDS_activism" target="_blank">HIV/AIDS Activism</a> - Societial, health, queer. "Social and political activism to raise awareness about HIV/AIDS, as well as to raise funds for effective treatment and care of people with AIDS (PWAs), has taken place in multiple nations across the world since the 1980s. As a disease that began in marginalized populations, efforts to mobilize funding, treatment, and fight discrimination have largely been dependent on the work of grassroots organizers directly confronting public health organizations (often government-managed medical bureaucracies) as well as politicians, drug companies, and other institutions."</p>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drag_queen#" target="_blank">Drag Queens</a> - Community, queer. "A drag queen is a person, usually male, who uses drag clothing and makeup to imitate and often exaggerate female gender signifiers and gender roles for entertainment purposes. Historically, drag queens have usually been gay men, and have been a part of gay culture."</p>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-dressing" target="_blank">Crossdressing</a> - Community, societial. "Cross-dressing is the act of wearing clothes traditionally or stereotypically associated with a different gender. From as early as pre-modern history, cross-dressing has been practiced in order to disguise, comfort, entertain, and express oneself."</p>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Effeminacy" target="_blank">Effeminacy</a> - Societial. "Effeminacy or male femininity is the embodiment of feminine traits in boys or men, particularly those considered untypical of men or masculinity. These traits include roles, stereotypes, behaviors, and appearances that are socially associated with women and girls. Throughout history, men considered effeminate have faced prejudice and discrimination. Gay men are often stereotyped as being effeminate, and vice versa. However, femininity, masculinity, and other forms of gender expression are independent of sexual orientation."</p>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bish%C5%8Dnen" target="_blank">Bishōnen</a> - "Bishōnen (美少年, IPA: [bʲiɕo̞ꜜːnẽ̞ɴ] ⓘ; also transliterated bishounen) is a Japanese term literally meaning "beautiful youth (boy)" and describes an aesthetic that can be found in disparate areas in East Asia: a young man of androgynous beauty. This word originated from the Tang dynasty poem Eight Immortals of the Wine Cup by Du Fu. It has always shown the strongest manifestation in Japanese pop culture, gaining in popularity due to the androgynous glam rock bands of the 1970s, but it has roots in ancient Japanese literature, the androsocial and androerotic ideals of the medieval Chinese imperial court and intellectuals, and Indian aesthetic concepts carried over from Hinduism, imported with Buddhism to China. Today, bishōnen are very popular among girls and women in Japan. Reasons for this social phenomenon may include the unique male and female social relationships found within the genre. Some have theorized that bishōnen provide a non-traditional outlet for gender relations. Moreover, it breaks down stereotypes surrounding feminine male characters. These are often depicted with very strong martial arts abilities, sports talent, high intelligence, dandy fashion, or comedic flair, traits that are usually assigned to the hero/protagonist role."</p>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Queer_theory" target="_blank">Queer Theory</a> - Societial, pscyhology, queer. "Queer theory is a field of post-structuralist critical theory that emerged in the early 1990s out of queer studies (formerly often known as gay and lesbian studies) and women's studies. The term 'queer theory' can have various meanings depending upon its usage, but has been broadly associated with the study and theorization of gender and sexual practices that exist outside of heterosexuality, and which challenge the notion that heterosexual desire is 'normal'. Following social constructivist developments in sociology, queer theorists are often critical of what they consider essentialist views of sexuality and gender. Instead, they study those concepts as social and cultural phenomena, often through an analysis of the categories, binaries, and language in which they are said to be portrayed."</p>
