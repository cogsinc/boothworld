<p style="text-align: right;">Victor is a albino rat "Toon" coming from the faraway city of Sketchbook. He has a thinner body type and seems to be a bit sickly in that regard. He is aged somewhere in his late 40s~early 50s. Victors default attire is his two-toned labcoat with large shoulder pads and far too many buttons. He wears large dark brown boots and a belt around his waist, that holds his dirty apron covered in unknown stains. He wears his original "tag" like a earring on his right, red gloves reach to above his elbows, which he refuses to take off. And most notably is his frightening mask, that is a mixture between a gas mask and one seen on a plague doctor. Although its purpose has less to do with filtering the air, and more of protecting Victors sensitive pale skin.</p>
<p style="text-align: right;">Underneath Victors mask is a long sunken face, his fur is a off-white color and tattered and long in many places. Particularly long around his chin, which looks a bit like a beard. Victor hides his face due to his aforementioned albinism, and also that Toons (And Cogs) find him utterly terrifying. And he, like, totally gives everyone the heebie jeebies. He wears red glasses underneath his mask, and his right ear is chipped. Victor has a unique "art style" reflective of his original place of origin, being sketchy. (Unintentionally like his personality)</p>
<p style="text-align: right;">Victor is not a average Toon anatomy wise, due to the odd circumstances of his life. As such, Victor does not have a standard "sense of humor" and cannot properly use gags. Pianos fall back onto him, he gets electrocuted, and water balloons soak him. He has a "realistic" response to being injured, (Likely from being a drawing of a anatomical study of a rat) and will take much longer to recover if hes greened. Speaking of being greened, although rarer due to his (lack of) humor, Victor appears very "tar covered" when greened. Like ink is dripping off of him, and will stain around his eye sockets and mouth until hes healed. Victor rarely engages in combat with either Toons or Cogs, and will easily fold and run away. He has a abnormally low laff meter that seems to fluctuate and vary in numbers.</p>

<h3 style="text-align: left;">Artist Notes:</h3>
<p style="text-align: left;"><img src="/Art/OCs/Toontown/Images/victormini.gif" width="15"> He is never seen without his gloves on. All clothes he wears must include something that covers from his hands to his elbows.<br>
<img src="/Art/OCs/Toontown/Images/victormini.gif" width="15"> He can be drawn without his mask on. But would realistically only do so indoors.<br>
<img src="/Art/OCs/Toontown/Images/victormini.gif" width="15"> If not in his default attire: Victor likes to wear victorian dresses and is very modestly dressed. He does not like flashy colors or too many accessories. Actually, any clothing that stays on Victor for a long period of time will begin to "desaturate"..<br>
<img src="/Art/OCs/Toontown/Images/victormini.gif" width="15"> Victor is abnormally tall in comparison to Toons (About the height of a Mover & Shaker) and fits abnormally in Toon infrastructure. If you find it too difficult to keep his height on model, just drawing him being tall is enough!<br>
<img src="/Art/OCs/Toontown/Images/victormini.gif" width="15"> If you want to experiment, try keeping Victor in a "sketchy/scratchy" lineart style!</p>



<div id="personality"><h2 style="background-color: orange; color: blue; text-align: left;"><img src="/Art/OCs/Toontown/Images/victorminibig.gif"> Personality <img src="/Art/OCs/Toontown/Images/victordiv.gif"></h2></div>
<p>Victor is a slimy weasel of a man, and should not be trusted. Victor is very determined in his one-man goals of furthering science and getting the recognition he believes hes always deserved. Although hes too prideful to admit when he needs help, and is very paranoid about his work being "tainted" or "stolen". Despite his apparent ego and proclivity to degrade others, Victor easily self loathes and cowers to higher authority.</p>
<p>Victor believes people are just puzzles he has to navigate. And hes very willing to play the long haul in order to get whatever he wants. Due to his eagerness to yesman whoever is foolish enough to remotely aid him, some detractors would argue hes not entirely believing in his ideals. Victor would argue saying the ends justify the means, even if for him that means leveling a building. Victor seems to have little care for the ramifications of his actions on others, believing that people naturally all want a one-up on each other.</p>
<p>At his worse, Victor is delusional and exhibits characteristics of being schizotypical; in regards to believing he "knows something others don't" and that he is somehow a "chosen one" or even "cursed with a burden". Part of this stems from a traumatic event (See: history section) involving a "mystery substance" that Victor was experimenting on. Ever since that day, Victor has had a fixation on necromancy and "what Toons are made of". Whatever his research is saying, it leads him to believe the feud between Toons and Cogs is a useless sham; and is likely the reason for his willingness to work with Cogs. Interestingly, he seems unable to really elaborate on what hes talking about.</p>
<p>At his best, Victor is just a eccentric man to be around who lets himself ramble and is highly opinionated. He has a slightly odd way of speaking, tending to use large and complicated words; sometimes word combinations that make no sense together. He can be smug and enjoys getting underneath other peoples skin, although he doesn't realize when his "playful banter" goes too far. Victor has a hard time indulging in pleasures or exactly understanding them. Any domestic things hes interested in he will write off with the flustered excuse of "researching the general population". But if invited somewhere, he will "begrudgingly" appear late.</p>

<h3 style="text-align: left;">Personality Rules</h3>
<p style="text-align: left;">
<img src="/Art/OCs/Toontown/Images/victormini.gif" width="15"> Victor is not a sympathetic antagonist. Despite his mental state, Victor is entirely aware of what a prick he is and how he can manipulate people. Any sympathy from tragic moments should end when reminded of how hes used it to become more cruel now.<br>
<img src="/Art/OCs/Toontown/Images/victormini.gif" width="15"> On-screen or in blatant writing, Victors experiments should be kept more lighthearted. He behaves like a normal cartoon villain scientist. His more true gruesome experiments should only be vaguely implied. Although hes pretty edgy, don't use him for shock value.<br>
<img src="/Art/OCs/Toontown/Images/victormini.gif" width="15"> Despite being morbidly curious and uncaring for those in pain, Victor is not a sadist and wouldn't just blatantly harm someone walking around. He would only torture someone if they deserved it!<br>
<img src="/Art/OCs/Toontown/Images/victormini.gif" width="15"> Victor is generally unsociable and even seems anxious at normal social interaction. Hes only talkative if hes trying to get something, someone is questioning his authenticity, or the rare chance he knows the person already.</p>



<div id="history"><h2 style="background-color: orange; color: blue; text-align: left;"><img src="/Art/OCs/Toontown/Images/victorminibig.gif"> History/Lore <img src="/Art/OCs/Toontown/Images/victordiv.gif"></h2></div>
<p>Victor hails from the distant city of Sketchbook. A monochrome city of oddities and casualty, a place so strange some wonder if its a urban legend. The method for visiting, or even leaving, is not conventional at all and not listed on any maps. Anyone thinking of having their summer vacation there never returns to tell the tale.</p>
<p>Victor was created after a scientist began experimenting with a certain kind of ink, and drew a anatomical sketch of a rat; This sketch sprung to life and kept as a test experiment. After somehow gaining higher sentience, Victor slithered away. And even stranger, out of the city at large. Victor cannot recall how this happened.</p>
<p>For years Victor honed larger skills in science, surgery, and medicine. Although he really shouldn't be considered the most.. efficient doctor. Desperate for a level of recognition, he began seeking out the elusive substance known as "dip". Managing to obtain it, somehow splashed parts of his arms, leaving him horribly scarred in a way a rewrite could not heal. This event triggered something deeper in him, that now is his obsession with the dead and necromancy. Victor seems to have a odd possessiveness over the study of dip. And becomes incoherent when trying to discuss it in a studious sense.</p>
<p>As it turns out, being a mad scientist is hard in todays economy. Victor moved from city to city for years after unleashing some type of abomination, and promptly being driven out by a mob. He swears hes now on his "best behavior" after moving to Ye Olde Toontowne.</p>
<p>Although aware of the existence of other species, Victor was largely unaware of the existence of Cogs (or the conflict in Toontown) until witnessing a Toon being greened. Fascinated by them and sensing a opportunity, he began sending Lawbot HQ various letters in an attempt to become their informant. Whatever he sent, or knows, was useful enough that now hes in regular correspondence in exchange for funding on his dubious projects. Although they're entirely unknowing, and uncaring, in what hes doing.</p>
