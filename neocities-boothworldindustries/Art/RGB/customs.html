<p>>Once the purchase is made the character is entirely yours. I will never ask to<br>revoke the character, and I do not care if you decide to resell. Credits must remain intact.</p>

<p>>If you opt to resell a character I designed in the future and have issues with another<br>user, please do not involve me.</p>

<p>>You are free to edit the character to your hearts desire and in any way you please.<br>Just please do not remove my credits on their profile or the original image they came with.</p>
