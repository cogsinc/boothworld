  <h2>-[<b><i><u>Splatnet Rules</b></i></u>]-</h2>
  <p>These are the rules for joining the Splatnet webring. <U>Last updated: 7/7/2024</U>.</p>

<hr>

  <h3>-JOINING/REQUIREMENTS-</h3>
<p>[1.] Webmasters must be over the age of 13 to join. Websites must be owned by the individual applying.<br><br>
[2.] Your website does not need to be hosted on Neocities. But cannot be: Carrd, Rentry, or a SNS (Like Tumblr or Twitter) It must be a static website you can edit the code of.<br><br>
[3.] Websites do not need to be Splatoon oriented. But please, do not submit websites that are heavily WIP or blank. Please have atleast something available to view on the site, and a place for the widget.<br><br>
[4.] Please keep in mind that the opinions of those who have joined Splatnet are not the opinions of the owner of the webring. However, we do not allow websites that host: Hate speech towards religion, race, gender, sexuality, disabilities, animal abuse, child abuse, harassment of other users, promote gambling, fraud, scams, phishing links, malicious links/downloads, conspiracy theories, real life gore/shock, or created with the intent to "troll". This includes on other platforms other then their website.</p>

<hr>

  <h3>-REGARDING MATURE OR NSFW WEBSITES-</h3>
<p>Although Splatoon is a game for all ages, the internet is not. But we do have some limits on what we allow. If your site is "mature" please read carefully. This does not apply to webmasters who: Have a link to their NSFW SNS account, or have a separate website for NSFW content that needs to be deliberately found by the visitor and is <i>not</i> the website they are using to join.<br><br>
[1.] We do not allow sites created to solely host NSFW content. (Written, drawn, or photographed) Please note we do not consider artistic nudity or simply just a naked form to be "NSFW" (Just think of stuff you wouldn't show your mom, or stuff you wouldn't see in a museum.)<br><br>
[2.] If your site is mature, you must have a warning page when you enter the URL saying so.<br><br>
[3.] Webmasters who do not host NSFW content but do not want minors viewing their page must follow similar rules, and both will have to have their widget on the front page to not break the ring.</p>
